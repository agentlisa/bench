  "Content": "\nWithin `notional-wrapped-fcash` `package.json`, an outdated OZ version is used (which has known vulnerabilities, see <https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3A%40openzeppelin%2Fcontracts>).\n\nHowever, as `Brownie` is used to install dependencies and compile the contracts, using this outdated version declared in the `package.json` does not impose any risks so far.\n\nAnyway, to prevent any issues in the future (e.g. using solely `hardhat` to compile and deploy the contracts), upgrade the used OZ packages within the `package.json` to the latest versions.\n\nSee similar findings:\n\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/81>\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/81>\n\n### Findings\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/main/notional-wrapped-fcash/package.json#L14>\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider using the latest OZ packages within `package.json`.\n\n",

Fixed rate loans are 25x variable rate loans in traditional financial markets because of the superior guarantees they offer. [Notional V1](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts) first introduced our concepts of how to achieve fixed rates on Ethereum and Notional V2 extends upon those concepts to add support for fixed term loans out to 20 years. Notional V2 also introduces many improvements upon Notional V1, including superior capital efficiency, better upgradeability, and on chain governance.\",\n  \"main\": \"hardhat.config.js\",\n  \"directories\": {\n    \"test\": \"tests\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"dotenv\": \"^10.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan\": \"^2.1.6\",\n    \"@openzeppelin/contracts\": \"^3.4.2-solc-0.7\",\n    \"hardhat\": \"^2.6.7\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"mocha\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/notional-finance/notional-solidity-sdk.git\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"Jeff Wu <jeff@notional.finance>\",\n  \"license\": \"GPL-v3\",\n  \"bugs\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/notional-finance/notional-solidity-sdk/issues\"\n  },\n  \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/notional-finance/notional-solidity-sdk#readme\"\n}"
