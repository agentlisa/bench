  "Content": "# Issue M-2: Protocol doesn't completely protect itself from `LTV = 0` tokens \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index-judging/issues/159 \n\n## Found by \nBauchibred, hildingr, volodya\n\n## Summary\n\nThe AaveLeverageStrategyExtension does not completely protect against tokens with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) of 0. Tokens with an LTV of 0 in Aave V3 pose significant risks, as they cannot be used as collateral to borrow upon a breaking withdraw. Moreover, LTVs of assets could be set to 0, even though they currently aren't, it could create substantial problems with potential disruption of multiple functionalities. This bug could cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) situation in some cases, and has a potential to impact the borrowing logic in the protocol, leading to an unintentionally large perceived borrowing limit.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nWhen an AToken has LTV = 0, Aave restricts the usage of certain operations. Specifically, if a user owns at least one AToken as collateral with an LTV = 0, certain operations could revert:\n\n1. **Withdraw**: If the asset being withdrawn is collateral and the user is borrowing something, the operation will revert if the withdrawn collateral is an AToken with LTV > 0.\n2. **Transfer**: If the asset being transferred is an AToken with LTV > 0 and the sender is using the asset as collateral and is borrowing something, the operation will revert.\n3. **Set the reserve of an AToken as non-collateral**: If the AToken being set as non-collateral is an AToken with LTV > 0, the operation will revert.\n\nTake a look at [AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1050-L1119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1050-L1119)\n\n```solidity\n    /**\n     * Calculate total notional rebalance quantity and chunked rebalance quantity in collateral units.\n     *\n     * return uint256          Chunked rebalance notional in collateral units\n     * return uint256          Total rebalance notional in collateral units\n     */\n    function _calculateChunkRebalanceNotional(\n        LeverageInfo memory _leverageInfo,\n        uint256 _newLeverageRatio,\n        bool _isLever\n    )\n        internal\n        view\n        returns (uint256, uint256)\n    {\n        // Calculate absolute value of difference between new and current leverage ratio\n        uint256 leverageRatioDifference = _isLever ? _newLeverageRatio.sub(_leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio) : _leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio.sub(_newLeverageRatio);\n\n        uint256 totalRebalanceNotional = leverageRatioDifference.preciseDiv(_leverageInfo.currentLeverageRatio).preciseMul(_leverageInfo.action.collateralBalance);\n\n        uint256 maxBorrow = _calculateMaxBorrowCollateral(_leverageInfo.action, _isLever);\n\n        uint256 chunkRebalanceNotional = Math.min(Math.min(maxBorrow, totalRebalanceNotional), _leverageInfo.twapMaxTradeSize);\n\n        return (chunkRebalanceNotional, totalRebalanceNotional);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Calculate the max borrow / repay amount allowed in base units for lever / delever.

LTV is measured in 4 decimals in Aave which is why we must multiply by 1e14\n        // for example ETH has an LTV value of 8000 which represents 80%\n        if (_isLever) {\n            uint256 netBorrowLimit = _actionInfo.collateralValue\n                .preciseMul(maxLtvRaw.mul(10 ** 14))\n                .preciseMul(PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit().sub(execution.unutilizedLeveragePercentage));\n\n            return netBorrowLimit\n                .sub(_actionInfo.borrowValue)\n                .preciseDiv(_actionInfo.collateralPrice);\n        } else {\n            uint256 netRepayLimit = _actionInfo.collateralValue\n                .preciseMul(liquidationThresholdRaw.mul(10 ** 14))\n                .preciseMul(PreciseUnitMath.preciseUnit().sub(execution.unutilizedLeveragePercentage));\n\n            return _actionInfo.collateralBalance\n                .preciseMul(netRepayLimit.sub(_actionInfo.borrowValue))\n                .preciseDiv(netRepayLimit);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nApart from the aforementioned issue with `LTV = 0` tokens, there's another issue with the `_calculateMaxBorrowCollateral()` function. When LTV = 0, `maxLtvRaw` also equals 0, leading to a `netBorrowLimit` of 0. When the borrowing value is subtracted from this, it results in an underflow, causing the borrowing limit to appear incredibly large. This essentially breaks the borrowing logic of the protocol.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis bug could potentially disrupt the entire borrowing logic within the protocol by inflating the perceived borrowing limit. This could lead to users borrowing an unlimited amount of assets due to the underflow error. In extreme cases, this could lead to a potential loss of user funds or even a complete protocol shutdown, thus impacting user trust and the overall functionality of the protocol.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\n[AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1050-L1119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/3190057afd3085143a31746d65045a0d1bacc78c/index-coop-smart-contracts/contracts/adapters/AaveLeverageStrategyExtension.sol#L1050-L1119)\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe protocol should consider implementing additional protections against tokens with an LTV of 0.\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**ckoopmann**\n\nThis raises a good point that wasn't fully considered during the design. \nWe will investigate this. \n\nGenerally I don't think the \"Impact\" section is accurate though as users cannot borrow assets on behalf of the token. However if the previous information is accurate it could have an affect on issuance / redemption if the aToken transfers are blocked.\n\n**ckoopmann**\n\nI set this to confirmed as the issue raises valid questions / scenarios that weren't fully considered during the design. \nUnfortunately the recommendation is pretty vague and not very actionable.\n\nAfter digging into [this audit report](https://www.certora.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Aave_v3_Core_PR_820_Review.pdf) it seems that at least there are protections in place on aave side that no malicious user could produce such a situation by sending us aTokens with ltv=0 or something like that.\nSo the only scenario where this situation could arise would be if aave governance sets the LTV of the collateral token we are using to 0.\n\nOne potential change that could allow us to delever the token in such a situation could be to add flashloan based delevering as also suggested in this issue:\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index-judging/issues/255\n\n**ckoopmann**\n\nAlso see this issue on the morpho spearbit audit for reference. (You will have to create an account solodit to access it) - note that the \"Vulernability Detail\" section seems to be copy / pasted from that report:\nhttps://solodit.xyz/issues/16216\n\n**ckoopmann**\n\nAfter rereading this more carefully it seems the above listed limitations only affect a second aToken with LTV > 0. So for this scenario to come into effect we would have to have two aTokens as components in the set, one of which would have `LTV = 0` and the other one (which would not be able to be transfered anymore) would have `LTV > 0`. \n\nWhile the issue seems to be valid, if the above understanding is correct we might keep the logic as is and list this as an explicit limitation. Because the strategy extension is designed to work with only one aToken anyway. (The Set Token could have another aToken as a component that is not managed as part of the leverage strategy but this should be avoided and is certainly not part of the expected use)\n\n**0xffff11**\n\n`While the issue seems to be valid, if the above understanding is correct we might keep the logic as is and list this as an explicit limitation`\nKeeping the issue as a med because there is still a small possibility for this to happen even though it is not the intended behavior: \n`he Set Token could have another aToken as a component that is not managed as part of the leverage strategy but this should be avoided and is certainly not part of the expected use`\n\n",
