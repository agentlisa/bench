  "Title": "[L09] Low test coverage on some contracts",
  "Content": "Writing tests is a critical part of the development process of a new protocol, as it allows developers to find bugs in their code before launch. While many of your contracts have 100% test coverage, a number of them have low test coverage, falling as low as 50% in [Governed.sol](https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-SmartYieldBonds/blob/943df3a8fcd8dd128af3beb0c85a0480c0e95ead/contracts/Governed.sol#L5). Consider adding more tests for the contracts, aiming for at least 95% test coverage across all contracts.\n\n\n**Update**: *Improved in commit [`688c85a966ba7033230608e1682356d0e40ecd23`](https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-SmartYieldBonds/commit/688c85a966ba7033230608e1682356d0e40ecd23mpn), but still under 95%. The referenced commit includes other changes to the codebase which have not been reviewed by OpenZeppelin.*\n\n\n",
