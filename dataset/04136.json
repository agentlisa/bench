  "Title": "[M01] Starting debt auctions can be prevented",
  "Content": "Within the [`AccountingEngine`](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/AccountingEngine.sol) contract, the function [`auctionDebt`](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/AccountingEngine.sol#L259) contains a check that the `AccountingEngine` contract instance [has no system coin balance](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/AccountingEngine.sol#L261). However, the [`transferInternalCoins` function](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/SAFEEngine.sol#L313) within the [`SAFEEngine`](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/SAFEEngine.sol) contract allows transfers of internal tokens to any contract, provided [`canModifySafe(src, msg.sender)`](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/SAFEEngine.sol#L314) returns true. Thus, any user can transfer their internal coins to the `AccountingEngine` contract. For any nonzero amount of coins, this will cause [the check within `auctionDebt`](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/AccountingEngine.sol#L261) to fail.\n\n\nThe result of this is that any user can front-run calls to `auctionDebt` to prevent them from executing, effectively preventing any new debt auctions from starting. However, it should be noted that eventually, the front-runner may fail in their front-running attempt, and at that point a new debt auction can begin.\n\n\nConsider replacing this check with a call to [`settleDebt(safeEngine.coinBalance(address(this))`](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/AccountingEngine.sol#L235) before [the balance check](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/blob/261407b6b332c2063e4256aa5f9b223d52dad7e1/src/AccountingEngine.sol#L261) is enforced. This may require changing the visibility of `settleDebt` to `public`.\n\n\n***Update:** Fixed in [pull request #75.](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb/pull/75/files)*\n\n\n",
