In these cases, the `startTime` calculation \n\n```solidity\nuint startTime = block.timestamp + vestingTime - (totalCoins / coinsPerSecond);\n```\n\nwill revert from division by zero, preventing initialization, and by extension, withdrawals of vested tokens.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nWe assume vesting time chosen is the maximum (`tree.maxEndTime`) so that `totalCoins = maxTotalPayments`. These examples showcase some possibilities for which the calculated `coinsPerSecond` can be zero.\n\n### Example 1: High upfront percentage\n\n- `pctUpFront = 99` (99% up front)\n- `totalCoins = 10_000e6` (10k USDC)\n- `vestingTime = 1 year`\n\n```solidity\nuint coinsPerSecond = (totalCoins * (uint(100) - tree.pctUpFront)) / (vestingTime * 100);\n// 10_000e6 * (100 - 99) / (365 * 86400 * 100)\n// = 0\n```\n\n### Example 2: Small reward amount / token decimals\n\n- `pctUpFront = 0`\n- `totalCoins = 100_000e2` (100k EURS)\n- `vestingTime = 180 days`\n\n```solidity\nuint coinsPerSecond = (totalCoins * (uint(100) - tree.pctUpFront)) / (vestingTime * 100);\n// 100_000e2 * 100 / (180 * 86400 * 100)\n// = 0\n```\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nScale up `coinsPerSecond` by `PRECISION`, then scale down when executing withdrawals. While it isn’t foolproof, the possibility of `coinsPerSecond` being zero is reduced significantly.\n\n```solidity\n// L264\nuint coinsPerSecond = (totalCoins * (uint(100) - tree.pctUpFront)) * PRECISION / (vestingTime * 100);\n\n// L184\ncurrentWithdrawal = (block.timestamp - tranche.lastWithdrawalTime) * tranche.coinsPerSecond / PRECISION;\n```\n\n",
