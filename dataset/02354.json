Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the bottom-layer transaction type, this proposal instead introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a `UserOperation`. Users send `UserOperation` objects into a separate mempool. A special class of actor called bundlers (either block builders, or users that can send transactions to block builders through a bundle marketplace) package up a set of these objects into a transaction making a `handleOps` call to a special contract, and that transaction then gets included in a block.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSee also `https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/implementing-account-abstraction-as-part-of-eth1-x/4020` and the links therein for historical work and motivation, and [EIP-2938](./eip-2938.md) for a consensus layer proposal for implementing the same goal.\n\nThis proposal takes a different approach, avoiding any adjustments to the consensus layer. It seeks to achieve the following goals:\n\n* **Achieve the key goal of account abstraction**: allow users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs as their primary account. Completely remove any need at all for users to also have EOAs (as status quo SC wallets and [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md) both require)\n* **Decentralization**\n    * Allow any bundler (think: block builder) to participate in the process of including account-abstracted user operations\n    * Work with all activity happening over a public mempool; users do not need to know the direct communication addresses (eg. IP, onion) of any specific actors\n    * Avoid trust assumptions on bundlers\n* **Do not require any Ethereum consensus changes**: Ethereum consensus layer development is focusing on the merge and later on scalability-oriented features, and there may not be any opportunity for further protocol changes for a long time. Hence, to increase the chance of faster adoption, this proposal avoids Ethereum consensus changes.\n* **Try to support other use cases**\n    * Privacy-preserving applications\n    * Atomic multi-operations (similar goal to [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md))\n    * Pay tx fees with [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) tokens, allow developers to pay fees for their users, and [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md)-like **sponsored transaction** use cases more generally\n    * Support aggregated signature (e.g. BLS)\n\n## Specification\n\n### Definitions\n\n* **UserOperation** - a structure that describes a transaction to be sent on behalf of a user. To avoid confusion, it is named \"transaction\".\n  * Like a transaction, it contains \"sender\", \"to\", \"calldata\", \"maxFeePerGas\", \"maxPriorityFee\", \"signature\", \"nonce\"\n  * unlike transaction, it contains several other fields, described below\n  * also, the \"nonce\" and \"signature\" fields usage is not defined by the protocol, but by each account implementation\n* **Sender** - the account contract sending a user operation.\n* **EntryPoint** - a singleton contract to execute bundles of UserOperations. Bundlers/Clients whitelist the supported entrypoint.\n* **Bundler** - a node (block builder) that bundles multiple UserOperations and create an EntryPoint.handleOps() transaction. Note that not all block-builders on the network are required to be bundlers\n* **Aggregator** - a helper contract trusted by accounts to validate an aggregated signature. Bundlers/Clients whitelist the supported aggregators.\n\n\nTo avoid Ethereum consensus changes, we do not attempt to create new transaction types for account-abstracted transactions. Instead, users package up the action they want their account to take in an ABI-encoded struct called a `UserOperation`:\n\n| Field | Type | Description\n| - | - | - |\n| `sender` | `address` | The account making the operation |\n| `nonce` | `uint256` | Anti-replay parameter; also used as the salt for first-time account creation |\n| `initCode` | `bytes` | The initCode of the account (needed if and only if the account is not yet on-chain and needs to be created) |\n| `callData` | `bytes` | The data to pass to the `sender` during the main execution call |\n| `callGasLimit` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate the main execution call |\n| `verificationGasLimit` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate for the verification step |\n| `preVerificationGas` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to pay for to compensate the bundler for pre-verification execution and calldata |\n| `maxFeePerGas` | `uint256` | Maximum fee per gas (similar to [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) `max_fee_per_gas`) |\n| `maxPriorityFeePerGas` | `uint256` | Maximum priority fee per gas (similar to EIP-1559 `max_priority_fee_per_gas`) |\n| `paymasterAndData` | `bytes` | Address of paymaster sponsoring the transaction, followed by extra data to send to the paymaster (empty for self-sponsored transaction) |\n| `signature` | `bytes` | Data passed into the account along with the nonce during the verification step |\n\nUsers send `UserOperation` objects to a dedicated user operation mempool. A specialized class of actors called **bundlers** (either block builders running special-purpose code, or users that can relay transactions to block builders eg. through a bundle marketplace such as Flashbots that can guarantee next-block-or-never inclusion) listen in on the user operation mempool, and create **bundle transactions**. A bundle transaction packages up multiple `UserOperation` objects into a single `handleOps` call to a pre-published global **entry point contract**.\n\nTo prevent replay attacks (both cross-chain and multiple `EntryPoint` implementations), the `signature` should depend on `chainid` and the `EntryPoint` address.\n\nThe core interface of the entry point contract is as follows:\n\n```solidity\nfunction handleOps(UserOperation[] calldata ops, address payable beneficiary);\n\nfunction handleAggregatedOps(\n    UserOpsPerAggregator[] calldata opsPerAggregator,\n    address payable beneficiary\n);\n\n    \nstruct UserOpsPerAggregator {\n    UserOperation[] userOps;\n    IAggregator aggregator;\n    bytes signature;\n}\nfunction simulateValidation(UserOperation calldata userOp);\n\nerror ValidationResult(ReturnInfo returnInfo,\n    StakeInfo senderInfo, StakeInfo factoryInfo, StakeInfo paymasterInfo);\n\nerror ValidationResultWithAggregation(ReturnInfo returnInfo,\n    StakeInfo senderInfo, StakeInfo factoryInfo, StakeInfo paymasterInfo,\n    AggregatorStakeInfo aggregatorInfo);\n\nstruct ReturnInfo {\n  uint256 preOpGas;\n  uint256 prefund;\n  bool sigFailed;\n  uint64 validAfter;\n  uint64 validUntil;\n  bytes paymasterContext;\n}\n\nstruct StakeInfo {\n  uint256 stake;\n  uint256 unstakeDelaySec;\n}\n\nstruct AggregatorStakeInfo {\n    address actualAggregator;\n    StakeInfo stakeInfo;\n}\n```\n\nThe core interface required for an account to have is:\n\n```solidity\ninterface IAccount {\n  function validateUserOp\n      (UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash, address aggregator, uint256 missingAccountFunds)\n      external returns (uint256 sigTimeRange);\n}\n```\n\nThe account\n\n* MUST validate the caller is a trusted EntryPoint\n* The userOpHash is a hash over the userOp (except signature), entryPoint and chainId\n* If the account does not support signature aggregation, it MUST validate the signature is a valid signature of the `userOpHash`, and\n  SHOULD return SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED (and not revert) on signature mismatch. Any other error should revert.\n* MUST pay the entryPoint (caller) at least the \"missingAccountFunds\" (which might be zero, in case current account's deposit is high enough)\n* The account MAY pay more than this minimum, to cover future transactions (it can always issue `withdrawTo` to retrieve it)\n* The `aggregator` SHOULD be ignored for accounts that don't use an aggregator\n* The return value is packed of sigFailure, validUntil and validAfter  timestamps.\n  * `sigFailure` is 1 byte value of \"1\" the signature check failed (should not revert on signature failure, to support estimate)\n  * `validUntil` is 8-byte timestamp value, or zero for \"infinite\". The UserOp is valid only up to this time.\n  * `validAfter` is 8-byte timestamp. The UserOp is valid only after this time.\n  \nAn account that works with aggregated signature should have the interface:\n\n```solidity\ninterface IAggregatedAccount is IAccount {\n\n  function getAggregator() view returns (address);\n}\n```\n\n* **getAggregator()** returns the aggregator this account supports.\n* **validateUserOp()** (inherited from IAccount interface) MUST verify the `aggregator` parameter is valid and the same as `getAggregator`\n* The account should also support aggregator-specific getter (e.g. `getAggregationInfo()`).\n  This method should export the account's public-key to the aggregator, and possibly more info\n  (note that it is not called directly by the entryPoint) \n* validateUserOp MAY ignore the signature field\n\nThe core interface required by an aggregator is:\n\n```solidity\ninterface IAggregator {\n\n  function validateUserOpSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp)\n  external view returns (bytes memory sigForUserOp);\n\n  function aggregateSignatures(UserOperation[] calldata userOps) external view returns (bytes memory aggregatesSignature);\n\n  function validateSignatures(UserOperation[] calldata userOps, bytes calldata signature) view external;\n}\n```\n\n* If an account uses an aggregator (returns it with getAggregator()), then its address is returned by `simulateValidation()` reverting with `ValidationResultWithAggregator` instead of `ValidationResult`\n* To accept the UserOp, the bundler must call **validateUserOpSignature()** to validate the userOp's signature.\n* **aggregateSignatures()** must aggregate all UserOp signature into a single value.  \n* Note that the above methods are helper method for the bundler. The bundler MAY use a native library to perform the same validation and aggregation logic.\n* **validateSignatures()** MUST validate the aggregated signature matches for all UserOperations in the array, and revert otherwise.\n  This method is called on-chain by `handleOps()`\n\n#### Using signature aggregators\n\nAn account signify it uses signature aggregation by exposing the aggregator's address in the `getAggregator()` method.\nDuring `simulateValidation`, this aggregator is returned (in the `ValidationResultWithAggregator`)\n\nThe bundler should first accept the aggregator (validate its stake info and that it is not throttled/banned)\nThen it MUST verify the userOp using `aggregator.validateUserOpSignature()`\n\nSignature aggregator SHOULD stake just like a paymaster, unless it is exempt due to not accessing global storage - see [reputation, throttling and banning section](#reputation-scoring-and-throttlingbanning-for-global-entities) for details. Bundlers MAY throttle down and ban aggregators in case they take too much\nresources (or revert) when the above methods are called in view mode, or if the signature aggregation fails.\n\n### Required entry point contract functionality\n\nThere are 2 separate entry point methods: `handleOps` and `handleAggregatedOps`\n\n* `handleOps` handle userOps of accounts that don't require any signature aggregator.\n* `handleAggregatedOps` can handle a batch that contains userOps of multiple aggregators (and also requests without any aggregator)\n* `handleAggregatedOps` performs the same logic below as `handleOps`, but it must transfer the correct aggregator to each userOp, and also must call `validateSignatures` on each aggregator after doing all the per-account validation.\nThe entry point's `handleOps` function must perform the following steps (we first describe the simpler non-paymaster case). It must make two loops, the **verification loop** and the **execution loop**. In the verification loop, the `handleOps` call must perform the following steps for each `UserOperation`:\n\n* **Create the account if it does not yet exist**, using the initcode provided in the `UserOperation`. If the account does not exist, _and_ the initcode is empty, or does not deploy a contract at the \"sender\" address, the call must fail.\n* **Call `validateUserOp` on the account**, passing in the `UserOperation`, the required fee and aggregator (if there is one). The account should verify the operation's signature, and pay the fee if the account considers the operation valid. If any `validateUserOp` call fails, `handleOps` must skip execution of at least that operation, and may revert entirely.\n* Validate the account's deposit in the entryPoint is high enough to cover the max possible cost (cover the already-done verification and max execution gas)\n\nIn the execution loop, the `handleOps` call must perform the following steps for each `UserOperation`:\n\n* **Call the account with the `UserOperation`'s calldata**. It's up to the account to choose how to parse the calldata; an expected workflow is for the account to have an `execute` function that parses the remaining calldata as a series of one or more calls that the account should make.\n\n![](../assets/eip-4337/image1.png)\n\nBefore accepting a `UserOperation`, bundlers should use an RPC method to locally call the `simulateValidation` function of the entry point, to verify that the signature is correct and the operation actually pays fees; see the [Simulation section below](#simulation) for details.\nA node/bundler SHOULD drop (and not add to the mempool) `UserOperation` that fails the validation\n\n### Extension: paymasters\n\nWe extend the entry point logic to support **paymasters** that can sponsor transactions for other users. This feature can be used to allow application developers to subsidize fees for their users, allow users to pay fees with [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) tokens and many other use cases. When the paymaster is not equal to the zero address, the entry point implements a different flow:\n\n![](../assets/eip-4337/image2.png)\n\nDuring the verification loop, in addition to calling `validateUserOp`, the `handleOps` execution also must check that the paymaster has enough ETH deposited with the entry point to pay for the operation, and then call `validatePaymasterUserOp` on the paymaster to verify that the paymaster is willing to pay for the operation. Note that in this case, the `validateUserOp` is called with a `missingAccountFunds` of 0 to reflect that the account's deposit is not used for payment for this userOp.\n\nIf the paymaster's validatePaymasterUserOp returns a \"context\", then `handleOps` must call `postOp` on the paymaster after making the main execution call. It must guarantee the execution of `postOp`, by making the main execution inside an inner call context, and if the inner call context reverts attempting to call `postOp` again in an outer call context.\n\nMaliciously crafted paymasters _can_ DoS the system. To prevent this, we use a reputation system. paymaster must either limit its storage usage, or have a stake. see the [reputation, throttling and banning section](#reputation-scoring-and-throttlingbanning-for-global-entities) for details.\n\nThe paymaster interface is as follows:\n\n```c++\n  function validatePaymasterUserOp\n    (UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash, uint256 maxCost)\n    external returns (bytes memory context, uint256 sigTimeRange);\n\nfunction postOp\n    (PostOpMode mode, bytes calldata context, uint256 actualGasCost)\n    external;\n\nenum PostOpMode {\n    opSucceeded, // user op succeeded\n    opReverted, // user op reverted. still has to pay for gas.\n    postOpReverted // user op succeeded, but caused postOp to revert\n}\n```\n\n\n```c++\n// add a paymaster stake (must be called by the paymaster)\nfunction addStake(uint32 _unstakeDelaySec) external payable\n\n// unlock the stake (must wait unstakeDelay before can withdraw)\nfunction unlockStake() external\n\n// withdraw the unlocked stake\nfunction withdrawStake(address payable withdrawAddress) external\n```\n\nThe paymaster must also have a deposit, which the entry point will charge UserOperation costs from.\nThe deposit (for paying gas fees) is separate from the stake (which is locked).\n\nThe entry point must implement the following interface to allow paymasters (and optionally accounts) manage their deposit:\n\n```c++\n// return the deposit of an account\nfunction balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256)\n\n// add to the deposit of the given account\nfunction depositTo(address account) public payable\n\n// withdraw from the deposit\nfunction withdrawTo(address payable withdrawAddress, uint256 withdrawAmount) external\n```\n\n### Client behavior upon receiving a UserOperation\n\nWhen a client receives a `UserOperation`, it must first run some basic sanity checks, namely that:\n\n* Either the `sender` is an existing contract, or the `initCode` is not empty (but not both)\n* If `initCode` is not empty, parse its first 20 bytes as a factory address.  Record whether the factory is staked, in case the later simulation indicates that it needs to be.  If the factory accesses global state, it must be staked - see [reputation, throttling and banning section](#reputation-scoring-and-throttlingbanning-for-global-entities) for details.\n* The `verificationGasLimit` is sufficiently low (`<= MAX_VERIFICATION_GAS`) and the `preVerificationGas` is sufficiently high (enough to pay for the calldata gas cost of serializing the `UserOperation` plus `PRE_VERIFICATION_OVERHEAD_GAS`)\n* The `paymasterAndData` is either empty, or start with the **paymaster** address, which is a contract that (i) currently has nonempty code on chain, (ii) has a sufficient deposit to pay for the UserOperation, and (iii) is not currently banned. During simulation, the paymaster's stake is also checked, depending on its storage usage - see [reputation, throttling and banning section](#reputation-scoring-and-throttlingbanning-for-global-entities) for details.\n* The callgas is at least the cost of a `CALL` with non-zero value.\n* The `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` are above a configurable minimum value that the client is willing to accept. At the minimum, they are sufficiently high to be included with the current `block.basefee`.\n* The sender doesn't have another `UserOperation` already present in the pool (or it replaces an existing entry with the same sender and nonce, with a higher `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and an equally increased `maxFeePerGas`). Only one `UserOperation` per sender may be included in a single batch. A sender is exempt from this rule and may have multiple `UserOperations` in the pool and in a batch if it is staked (see [reputation, throttling and banning section](#reputation-scoring-and-throttlingbanning-for-global-entities) below), but this exception is of limited use to normal accounts.\n\nIf the `UserOperation` object passes these sanity checks, the client must next run the first op simulation, and if the simulation succeeds, the client must add the op to the pool. A second simulation must also happen during bundling to make sure the UserOperation is still valid.\n\n### Simulation\n\n#### Simulation Rationale\n\nIn order to add a UserOperation into the mempool (and later to add it into a bundle) we need to \"simulate\" it to make sure it is valid, and that it is capable of paying for its own execution.\nIn addition, we need to verify that the same will hold true when executed on-chain.\nFor this purpose, a UserOperation is not allowed to access any information that might change between simulation and execution, such as current block time, number, hash etc.\nIn addition, a UserOperation is only allowed to access data related to this sender address: Multiple UserOperations should not access the same storage, so that it is impossible to invalidate a large number of UserOperations with a single state change.\nThere are 3 special contracts that interact with the account: the factory (initCode) that deploys the contract, the paymaster that can pay for the gas, and signature aggregator (described later)\nEach of these contracts is also restricted in its storage access, to make sure UserOperation validations are isolated.\n\n#### Specification:\n\nTo simulate a `UserOperation` validation, the client makes a view call to `simulateValidation(userop)`\n\nThis method always revert with `ValidationResult` as successful response.\nIf the call reverts with other error, the client rejects this `userOp`.\n\nThe simulated call performs the full validation, by calling:\n\n1. If `initCode` is present, create the account.\n2. `account.validateUserOp`.\n3. if specified a paymaster: `paymaster.validatePaymasterUserOp`.\n\nEither `validateUserOp` or `validatePaymasterUserOp` may return a \"validAfter\" and \"validUntil\" timestamps, which is the time-range that this UserOperation is valid on-chain.\nThe simulateValidation call returns this range.\nA node MAY drop a UserOperation if it expires too soon (e.g. wouldn't make it to the next block)\n\nThe operations differ in their opcode banning policy.\nIn order to distinguish between them, there is a call to the NUMBER opcode (`block.number`), used as a delimiter between the 3 functions.\nWhile simulating `userOp` validation, the client should make sure that:\n\n1. May not invokes any **forbidden opcodes**\n2. Must not use GAS opcode (unless followed immediately by one of { `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CALLCODE`, `STATICCALL` }.)\n3. Storage access is limited as follows:\n   1. self storage (of factory/paymaster, respectively) is allowed, but only if self entity is staked\n   2. account storage access is allowed (see Storage access by Slots, below),\n   3. in any case, may not use storage used by another UserOp `sender` in the same bundle (that is, paymaster and factory are not allowed as senders)\n4. Limitation on \"CALL\" opcodes (`CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CALLCODE`, `STATICCALL`):\n   1. must not use value (except from account to the entrypoint)\n   2. must not revert with out-of-gas\n   3. destination address must have code (EXTCODESIZE>0)\n   4. cannot call EntryPoint's `handleOps` method (to avoid recursion)\n5. `EXTCODEHASH` of every address accessed (by any opcode) does not change between first and second simulations of the op.\n6. `EXTCODEHASH`, `EXTCODELENGTH`, `EXTCODECOPY` may not access address with no code.\n7. If `op.initcode.length != 0` , allow only one `CREATE2` opcode call (in the first (deployment) block), otherwise forbid `CREATE2`.\n\n#### Storage associated with an address\n\nWe define storage slots as \"associated with an address\" as all the slots that uniquely related on this address, and cannot be related with any other address.\nIn solidity, this includes all storage of the contract itself, and any storage of other contracts that use this contract address as a mapping key.\n\nAn address `A` is associated with:\n\n1. Slots of contract `A` address itself.\n2. Slot `A` on any other address.\n3. Slots of type `keccak256(A || X) + n` on any other address. (to cover `mapping(address => value)`, which is usually used for balance in EIP-20 tokens).\n   `n` is an offset value up to 128, to allow accessing fields in the format `mapping(address => struct)`\n\n\n#### Alternative Mempools\n\nThe simulation rules above are strict and prevent the ability of paymasters and signature aggregators to grief the system.\nHowever, there might be use-cases where specific paymasters (and signature aggregators) can be validated\n(through manual auditing) and verified that they cannot cause any problem, while still require relaxing of the opcode rules.\nA bundler cannot simply \"whitelist\" request from a specific paymaster: if that paymaster is not accepted by all\nbundlers, then its support will be sporadic at best.\nInstead, we introduce the term \"alternate mempool\".\nUserOperations that use  whitelisted paymasters (or signature aggregators) are put into a separate mempool.\nOnly bundlers that support this whitelist will use UserOperations from this mempool.\nThese UserOperations can be bundled together with UserOperations from the main mempool\n\n### Bundling\n\nDuring bundling, the client should:\n\n* Exclude UserOps that access any sender address of another UserOp in the same batch.\n* Exclude UserOps that access any address created by another UserOp validation in the same batch (via a factory).\n* For each paymaster used in the batch, keep track of the balance while adding UserOps. Ensure that it has sufficient deposit to pay for all the UserOps that use it.\n* Sort UserOps by aggregator, to create the lists of UserOps-per-aggregator.\n* For each aggregator, run the aggregator-specific code to create aggregated signature, and update the UserOps\n\nAfter creating the batch, before including the transaction in a block, the client should:\n\n* Run `eth_estimateGas` with maximum possible gas, to verify the entire `handleOps` batch transaction, and use the estimated gas for the actual transaction execution.\n* If the call reverted, check the `FailedOp` event. A `FailedOp` during `handleOps` simulation is an unexpected event since it was supposed to be caught by the single-UserOperation simulation. Remove the failed op that caused the revert from the batch and drop from the mempool. Other ops from the same paymaster should be removed from the current batch, but kept in the mempool. Repeat until `eth_estimateGas` succeeds.\n\nIn practice, restrictions (2) and (3) basically mean that the only external accesses that the account and the paymaster can make are reading code of other contracts if their code is guaranteed to be immutable (eg. this is useful for calling or delegatecalling to libraries).\n\nIf any of the three conditions is violated, the client should reject the `op`. If both calls succeed (or, if `op.paymaster == ZERO_ADDRESS` and the first call succeeds)without violating the three conditions, the client should accept the op. On a bundler node, the storage keys accessed by both calls must be saved as the `accessList` of the `UserOperation`\n\nWhen a bundler includes a bundle in a block it must ensure that earlier transactions in the block don't make any UserOperation fail. It should either use access lists to prevent conflicts, or place the bundle as the first transaction in the block.\n\n#### Forbidden opcodes\n\nThe forbidden opcodes are to be forbidden when `depth > 2` (i.e. when it is the factory, account, paymaster, or other contracts called by them that are being executed). They are: `GASPRICE`, `GASLIMIT`, `DIFFICULTY`, `TIMESTAMP`, `BASEFEE`, `BLOCKHASH`, `NUMBER`, `SELFBALANCE`, `BALANCE`, `ORIGIN`, `GAS`, `CREATE`, `COINBASE`, `SELFDESTRUCT`. They should only be forbidden during verification, not execution. These opcodes are forbidden because their outputs may differ between simulation and execution, so simulation of calls using these opcodes does not reliably tell what would happen if these calls are later done on-chain.\n\nExceptions to the forbidden opcodes:\n\n1. A single `CREATE2` is allowed if `op.initcode.length != 0` and must result in the deployment of a previously-undeployed `UserOperation.sender`.\n2. `GAS` is allowed if followed immediately by one of { `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CALLCODE`, `STATICCALL` }.\n   (that is, making calls is allowed, using `gasleft()` or `gas` opcode directly is forbidden)\n\n### Reputation scoring and throttling/banning for global entities\n\n#### Reputation Rationale.\n\nUserOperation's storage access rules prevent them from interfere with each other.\nBut \"global\" entities - paymasters, factories and aggregators are accessed by multiple UserOperations, and thus might invalidate multiple previously-valid UserOperations.\n\nTo prevent abuse, we throttle down (or completely ban for a period of time) an entity that causes invalidation of large number of UserOperations in the mempool.\nTo prevent such entities from \"sybil-attack\", we require them to stake with the system, and thus make such DoS attack very expensive.\nNote that this stake is never slashed, and can be withdrawn any time (after unstake delay)\n\nUnstaked entities are allowed, under the rules below.\n\nWhen staked, an entity is also allowed to use its own associated storage, in addition to sender's associated storage.\n\nThe stake value is not enforced on-chain, but specifically by each node while simulating a transaction.\nThe stake is expected to be above MIN_STAKE_VALUE, and unstake delay above MIN_UNSTAKE_DELAY\nThe value of MIN_UNSTAKE_DELAY is 84600 (one day)\nThe value of MIN_STAKE_VALUE is determined per chain, and specified in the \"bundler specification test suite\"\n\n#### Un-staked entities\n\nUnder the following special conditions, unstaked entities still can be used:\n\n- An entity that doesn't use any storage at all, or only the senders's storage (not the entity's storage - that does require a stake)\n- If the UserOp doesn't create a new account (that is initCode is empty), then the entity may also use [storage associated with the sender](#storage-associated-with-an-address))\n- A paymaster that has a “postOp()” method (that is, validatePaymasterUserOp returns “context”) must be staked\n\n#### Specification.\n\nIn the following specification, \"entity\" is either address that is explicitly referenced by the UserOperation: sender, factory, paymaster and aggregator.\nClients maintain two mappings with a value for staked entities:\n\n* `opsSeen: Map[Address, int]`\n* `opsIncluded: Map[Address, int]`\n\nIf an entity doesn't use storage at all, or only reference storage associated with the \"sender\" (see [Storage associated with an address](#storage-associated-with-an-address)), then it is considered \"OK\", without using the rules below.\n\nWhen the client learns of a new staked entity, it sets `opsSeen[paymaster] = 0` and `opsIncluded[paymaster] = 0` .\n\nThe client sets `opsSeen[entity] +=1` each time it adds an op with that `entity` to the `UserOperationPool`, and the client sets `opsIncluded[entity] += 1` each time an op that was in the `UserOperationPool` is included on-chain.\n\nEvery hour, the client sets `opsSeen[entity] -= opsSeen[entity] // 24` and `opsIncluded[entity] -= opsIncluded[entity] // 24` for all entities (so both values are 24-hour exponential moving averages).\n\nWe define the **status** of an entity as follows:\n\n```python\nOK, THROTTLED, BANNED = 0, 1, 2\n\ndef status(paymaster: Address,\n           opsSeen: Map[Address, int],\n           opsIncluded: Map[Address, int]):\n    if paymaster not in opsSeen:\n        return OK\n    min_expected_included = opsSeen[paymaster] // MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR\n    if min_expected_included <= opsIncluded[paymaster] + THROTTLING_SLACK:\n        return OK\n    elif min_expected_included <= opsIncluded[paymaster] + BAN_SLACK:\n        return THROTTLED\n    else:\n        return BANNED\n```\n\nStated in simpler terms, we expect at least `1 / MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR` of all ops seen on the network to get included. If an entity falls too far behind this minimum, it gets **throttled** (meaning, the client does not accept ops from that paymaster if there is already an op with that entity, and an op only stays in the pool for 10 blocks), If the entity falls even further behind, it gets **banned**. Throttling and banning naturally decay over time because of the exponential-moving-average rule.\n\n**Non-bundling clients and bundlers should use different settings for the above params**:\n\n| Param | Client setting | Bundler setting |\n| - | - | - |\n| `MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR` | 100 | 10 |\n| `THROTTLING_SLACK` | 10 | 10 |\n| `BAN_SLACK` | 50 | 50 |\n\nTo help make sense of these params, note that a malicious paymaster can at most cause the network (only the p2p network, not the blockchain) to process `BAN_SLACK * MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR / 24` non-paying ops per hour.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe main challenge with a purely smart contract wallet based account abstraction system is DoS safety: how can a block builder including an operation make sure that it will actually pay fees, without having to first execute the entire operation? Requiring the block builder to execute the entire operation opens a DoS attack vector, as an attacker could easily send many operations that pretend to pay a fee but then revert at the last moment after a long execution. Similarly, to prevent attackers from cheaply clogging the mempool, nodes in the P2P network need to check if an operation will pay a fee before they are willin"
