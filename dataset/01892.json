However, this approach can lead to potential issues if WBTC were to depeg from BTC. In such a scenario, WBTC would no longer maintain an equivalent value to BTC. This can result in significant problems, including borrowing against a devalued asset and the accumulation of bad debt. Given that the protocol continues to value WBTC based on BTC/USD, the issuance of bad loans would persist, exacerbating the overall level of bad debt.\n\nImportant to note that this is like a 2 in 1 report as the same idea could work on the StableOracleWBGL contract too.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the reliance on a single BTC/USD Chainlink oracle to obtain the price of WBTC. If the bridge connecting WBTC to BTC becomes compromised and WBTC depegs, WBTC may depeg from BTC. Consequently, WBTC's value would no longer be equivalent to BTC, potentially rendering it worthless (hopefully this never happens). The use of the BTC/USD oracle to price WBTC poses risks to the protocol and its users.\n\nThe following code snippet represents the relevant section of the StableOracleWBTC contract responsible for retrieving the price of WBTC using the BTC/USD Chainlink oracle:\n\n```solidity\ncontract StableOracleWBTC is IStableOracle {\n    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed;\n\n    constructor() {\n        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(\n            0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419\n\n        );\n    }\n\n    function getPriceUSD() external view override returns (uint256) {\n        (, int256 price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();\n        // chainlink price data is 8 decimals for WBTC/USD\n        return uint256(price) * 1e10;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNB: key to note that the above pricefeed is set to the wrong aggregator, the correct one is this: `0x2260FAC5E5542a773Aa44fBCfeDf7C193bc2C599`\n\n## Impact\n\nShould the WBTC bridge become compromised or WBTC depeg from BTC, the protocol would face severe consequences. The protocol would be burdened with a substantial amount of bad debt stemming from outstanding loans secured by WBTC. Additionally, due to the protocol's reliance on the BTC/USD oracle, the issuance of loans against WBTC would persist even if its value has significantly deteriorated. This would lead to an escalation in bad debt, negatively impacting the protocol's financial stability and overall performance.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\n[StableOracleWBTC.sol#L12-L26](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/6d7a9fdfb1f1ed838632c25b6e1b01748d0bafda/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWBTC.sol#L12-L26)\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability mentioned above, it is strongly recommended to implement a double oracle setup for WBTC pricing. This setup would involve integrating both the BTC/USD Chainlink oracle and an additional on-chain liquidity-based oracle, such as UniV3 TWAP.\n\nThe double oracle setup serves two primary purposes. Firstly, it reduces the risk of price manipulation by relying on the Chainlink oracle, which ensures accurate pricing for WBTC. Secondly, incorporating an on-chain liquidity-based oracle acts as a safeguard against WBTC depegging. By monitoring the price derived from the liquidity-based oracle and comparing it to the Chainlink oracle's price, borrowing activities can be halted if the threshold deviation (e.g., 2% lower) is breached.\n\nAdopting a double oracle setup enhances the protocol's stability and minimizes the risks associated with WBTC depegging. It ensures accurate valuation, reduces the accumulation of bad debt, and safeguards the protocol and its users\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**Bauchibred**\n\nEscalate for 10 USDC\n\n\n\nI believe this issue has been incorrectly duplicated to #817. While I acknowledge the large number of issues submitted during the contest (approximately 1000), it's crucial to clarify that the concern here is not solely related to oracle addresses, despite the inclusion of wrong aggregators and inactive oracle addresses in the report. The main issue at hand is the potential depegging of WBTC, which is a bridged asset.\n\nTo address this vulnerability, the recommendation proposes implementing a double oracle setup for WBTC pricing, which serves as a safeguard against WBTC depegging.\n\nTo support this escalation, I have provided references to relevant cases:\n- #836 is a sponsor-validated issue that emphasizes the importance of not relying solely on 100% of an asset's oracle price. While it may not directly relate to this specific issue, it underscores the need to consider implementing a \"deviation threshold\" when determining asset prices, particularly in the context of bridged assets.\n-  #862, which is a valid duplicate, explores the potential impact of depegging on the protocol within a different context for this contest.\n- Additionally, references [1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-judging/blob/533cfb7357175fc97d6816586e95ad39e07892a7/060-M/320.md) and [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-judging/blob/533cfb7357175fc97d6816586e95ad39e07892a7/060-M/104-best.md?plain=1#L5) are previous validated findings from other contests that further emphasize the standalone nature and significance of this issue.\n\nI believe these references provide additional insights into the importance of considering measures to mitigate risks associated with bridged assets and emphasize why this issue should be treated as a standalone concern.\n\n\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n > Escalate for 10 USDC\n> \n> \n> \n> I believe this issue has been incorrectly duplicated to #817.

Since it is issued by a centralized entity (BitGo) it should be treated as trusted, because the only way for it to depeg would be via an error of this centralized entity or if the DAO voted a malicious proposal. See for details: https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/wbtc-what-is-wrapped-bitcoin#section-how-w-btc-works\n\nAdditionally, one of the justifications used to support the escalation regarding the deviation threshold mentioned in [#836 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD-judging/issues/836). There is no guarantee that the TWAP will not stay within the deviation threshold even in the (very) unlikely event that WBTC/BTC depegs if the depegging happens slowly.\n\nRegarding #862, this is not a duplicate to this report because DAI principal depeg risk comes from depegging of the underlying collateral reserves, which as we have seen is not possible for WBTC since the reserves are held by a centralized party. Also #862 specifically related to an overflow problem during a potential DAI depeg which is totally different than this report.\n\nThese are all the reason why I think this report is invalid.\n\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n > Escalate for 10 USDC\n> \n> Comments from [Bauchibred](https://github.com/Bauchibred) regarding the fact that the present issue #310 is not a duplicate of #817 are correct.\n> However, the main argument of this report is that:\n> >WBTC may depeg from BTC\n> \n> The only fact that WBTC/BTC would depeg is questionable.
