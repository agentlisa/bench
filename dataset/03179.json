  "Title": "[L02] Incorrect event parameter [core]",
  "Content": "After processing a deposit, the `StakeManager` emits a [`Deposited` event](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/8832d6e04b9f4f706f612261c6e46b3f1745d61a/contracts/StakeManager.sol#L76), but incorrectly uses the `msg.sender` instead of the updated account as the `account` parameter. This may mislead observers and offline processing systems. Consider updating the `account` parameter to match the deposit functionality.\n\n\n***Update**: Fixed in pull request [#50](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/pull/50/files).*\n\n\n",
