  "Title": "[06] CALLING `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` FUNCTION DOES NOT REVERT WHEN LOW LEVEL CALL TO `_tx.target` FAILS FOR SOME REASONS OTHER THAN HAVING INSUFFICIENT GAS IN CURRENT CONTEXT",
  "Content": "Calling the `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` function can result in a false `success` when the low level call to `_tx.target` fails for some reasons other than having insufficient gas in the current context. In this case, since `tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS` is false, calling the `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` function would not revert, the withdrawal transaction is considered as finalized in which `finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash]` would be set to true even though the low level call to `_tx.target` fails, and the associated funds to be withdrawn remain in the `OptimismPortal` contract. Because `finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash]` is already true, calling the `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` function for the same `withdrawalHash` again would revert due to `require(finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] == false, \"OptimismPortal: withdrawal has already been finalized\")`. To allow the reattempt for withdrawing the funds for the same `withdrawalHash` in this situation, please consider updating the `OptimismPortal.finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` function to revert when `success == false` is true without requiring `tx.origin == Constants.ESTIMATION_ADDRESS` to also be true.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/6eb05430d1ec1ae18ee96c2a206c60cc80fcbcf6/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L325-L420\n```solidity\n    function finalizeWithdrawalTransaction(Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx)\n        external\n        whenNotPaused\n    {\n        ...\n\n        // Check that this withdrawal has not already been finalized, this is replay protection.\n        require(\n            finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] == false,\n            \"OptimismPortal: withdrawal has already been finalized\"\n        );\n\n        // Mark the withdrawal as finalized so it can't be replayed.\n        finalizedWithdrawals[withdrawalHash] = true;\n\n        // Set the l2Sender so contracts know who triggered this withdrawal on L2.\n        l2Sender = _tx.sender;\n\n        // Trigger the call to the target contract.
