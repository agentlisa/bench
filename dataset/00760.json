  "Content": "# Issue M-6: The use of spot data when discounting is subjected to manipulation \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5-judging/issues/36 \n\n## Found by \nxiaoming90\n## Summary\n\nThe use of spot data when discounting is subjected to manipulation. As a result, malicious users could receive more cash than expected during redemption by performing manipulation. Since this is a zero-sum, the attacker's gain is the protocol loss.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nWhen redeeming wfCash before maturity, the `_sellfCash` function will be executed.\n\nAssume that there is insufficient fCash left on the wrapper to be sold back to the Notional AMM. In this case, the `getPrincipalFromfCashBorrow` view function will be used to calculate the number of prime cash to be withdrawn for a given fCash amount and sent to the users.\n\nNote that the `getPrincipalFromfCashBorrow` view function uses the spot data (spot interest rate, spot utilization, spot totalSupply/totalDebt, etc.) internally when computing the prime cash to be withdrawn for a given fCash. Thus, it is subjected to manipulation.\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5/blob/main/contracts-v3/contracts/external/CalculationViews.sol#L440\n\n```solidity\nFile: wfCashLogic.sol\n274:     /// @dev Sells an fCash share back on the Notional AMM\n275:     function _sellfCash(\n276:         address receiver,\n277:         uint256 fCashToSell,\n278:         uint32 maxImpliedRate\n279:     ) private returns (uint256 tokensTransferred) {\n280:         (IERC20 token, bool isETH) = getToken(true); \n281:         uint256 balanceBefore = isETH ?

The interest rate is used to discount the fCash back to cash before maturity. In summary, a higher interest rate will cause the fCash to be discounted more, and the current cash value will be smaller. The opposite is also true (Lower interest rate => Higher cash returned).\n\nAssume that the current utilization rate is slightly above Kink 1. When Bob redeems his wfCash, the interest rate used falls within the gentle slope between Kink 1 and Kink 2. Let the interest rate based on current utilization be 4%. The amount of fCash will be discounted back with 4% interest rate to find out the cash value (present value) and the returned value is $x$.\n\nObserved that before Kink 1, the interest rate changed sharply. If one could nudge the utilization toward the left (toward zero) and cause the utilization to fall between Kink 0 and Kink 1, the interest rate would fall sharply. Since the utilization is computed as on `utilization = totalfCash/totalCashUnderlying`, one could deposit prime cash to the market to increase the denominator (`totalCashUnderlying`) to bring down the utilization rate.\n\nBob deposits a specific amount of prime cash (either by its own funds or flash-loan) to reduce the utilization rate, which results in a reduction in interest rate. Assume that the interest rate reduces to 1.5%. The amount of fCash will be discounted with a lower interest rate of 1.5%, which will result in higher cash value, and the returned value/received cash is $y$.\n\n$y > x$. So Bob received $y - x$ more cash compared to if he had not performed the manipulation. Since this is a zero-sum, Bob's gain is the protocol loss.\n\n![IR](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5-xiaoming9090/assets/102820284/994ebd24-1699-40b4-aaec-3d7d3f6fd11a)\n\n## Impact\n\nMalicious users could receive more cash than expected during redemption by performing manipulation. Since this is a zero-sum, the attacker's gain is the protocol loss.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-notional-update-5/blob/main/contracts-v3/contracts/external/CalculationViews.sol#L440\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAvoid using spot data when computing the amount of assets that the user is entitled to during redemption. Consider using a TWAP/Time-lagged oracle to guard against potential manipulation.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**jeffywu**\n\nThis is valid, we should apply some slippage check against the `maxImpliedRate` that the user submits to this method against the calculation method.\n\n**sherlock-admin2**\n\n1 comment(s) were left on this issue during the judging contest.\n\n**takarez** commented:\n>  valid because { valid and seem to be by same watson as issue 028;duplicate}\n\n\n\n**T-Woodward**\n\nI would reduce the severity on this because there's no direct financial incentive for someone to manipulate the rate here. No actual trade occurs, so there's nothing to frontrun/sandwich. The attacker would incur a cost to manipulate this and receive no offsetting direct benefit.\n\nI think the proper mitigation for this is what @jeffywu has suggested which is to implement a slippage check on this calculation.\n\n**nevillehuang**\n\n@T-Woodward @jeffywu There seems to be some discussion in severity for this and #28. What is the worst case scenario for manipulating spot data? Is my understanding of it being it will take alot of funds to manipulate to gain some profits in terms of cash received correct?\n\n**T-Woodward**\n\n@nevillehuang manipulation would cost a lot and there would be no chance to gain any profit. The attacker would lose money. The negative impact is that a regular user would also lose money. But given that an attacker can not profit from this, I recommend medium severity, not high severity.\n\n",
