  "Content": "# Issue M-6: QV strategy cannot receive native token \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/256 \n\n## Found by \n0xarno, 0xc0ffEE, 0xkaden, Arz, B353N, Martians, Proxy, WATCHPUG, alexxander, bronze\\_pickaxe, jkoppel, tnquanghuy0512, twcctop, vangrim\nThe RFP and DonationMerkle strategies have a receive() method so that they can be funded with native token.  The QV strategy does not, and therefore it is incompatible with the native token.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nSee summary\n\n## Impact\n\nCannot use QV strategy with native token.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L574\n\nNotice the lack of a receive() method, which is also lacking in QVSimpleStrategy.  In contrast, the others have it, e.g.: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L500 .\n\nAllo.fundPool calls _transferAmountFrom: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516 . Tracing the definitions, it invokes the strategy with `call(gas(), to, amount, gas(), 0x00, gas(), 0x00)` (in SafeTransferLib). I.e.: it invokes it with empty calldata, and will therefore try to call receive() and  revert.\n\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\n\nAdd a receive() method.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n1 comment(s) were left on this issue during the judging contest.\n\n**n33k** commented:\n> low, no fund lose, only incompatible with NATIVE token, should consider to fix\n\n\n\n**jkoppel**\n\nEscalate.\n\nActually, there can be fund loss. If you attempt to create a pool but do not grant it initial funds, then you'll have paid the baseFee for pool creation but will have an inoperable pool. Further, Sherlock rules do consider valid  issues that prevent contracts from achieving their purpose, even in the absence of fund loss.\n\n**sherlock-admin2**\n\n > Escalate.\n> \n> Actually, there can be fund loss. If you attempt to create a pool but do not grant it initial funds, then you'll have paid the baseFee for pool creation but will have an inoperable pool. Further, Sherlock rules do consider valid  issues that prevent contracts from achieving their purpose, even in the absence of fund loss.\n\nYou've created a valid escalation!\n\nTo remove the escalation from consideration: Delete your comment.\n\nYou may delete or edit your escalation comment anytime before the 48-hour escalation window closes. After that, the escalation becomes final.\n\n**nevillehuang**\n\n> Escalate.\n> \n> Actually, there can be fund loss. If you attempt to create a pool but do not grant it initial funds, then you'll have paid the baseFee for pool creation but will have an inoperable pool. Further, Sherlock rules do consider valid issues that prevent contracts from achieving their purpose, even in the absence of fund loss.\n\nIf it reverts due to lack of receive payable, doesn't it mean pool creator get back the fees they paid?\n\nBut i do agree that this breaks core functionality since it is explicitly stated by protocol that all tokens are supported, even native ETH which is so widely used. I am inclined to think this is medium severity since i am very sure the protocol does not intend to not support native ETH for funding, which can potentially cause loss of fees.\n\n\nSidenote: #27,  #299, #363, #506, #521, #541, #549, #595, #624, #677, #894, #941, #957 are valid duplicates of this issue.\n\n**jkoppel**\n\nNice work finding the duplicates!\n\n> If it reverts due to lack of receive payable, doesn't it mean pool creator get back the fees they paid?\n\nOnly if you try to fund the pool at creation time.\n\n**0x00ffDa**\n\nTo [qualify for Medium](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging#ii.-criteria-for-issue-severity), I think it depends whether the fees lost would constitute \"a material amount of funds\". Also, the protocol owner can refund the fee to the user, so arguably not lost at all.\n\nFor me, I didn't report this because, although it's a valid issue ... I expected it to be judged Low. It will be interesting to see what they decide.\n\n**thelostone-mc**\n\nWould agree that this is an issue which needs to be fixed\n\n**neeksec**\n\nSuggest to keep make this low/info.\n\nThe fees lost is not \"a material amount of funds\" and could be refunded by Allo team.\n\n**MLON33**\n\nhttps://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/pull/376\n\n**Evert0x**\n\nI believe this falls into the same category as https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/862#issuecomment-1777391236\n\nhttps://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging#v.-how-to-identify-a-medium-issue\n> Breaks core contract functionality, rendering the contract useless\n\nPlanning to accept and make medium, but will get back to this.\n\n**Evert0x**\n\n> But i do agree that this breaks core functionality since it is explicitly stated by protocol that all tokens are supported, even native ETH \n\n@nevillehuang where is this stated?\n\n**nevillehuang**\n\n> > But i do agree that this breaks core functionality since it is explicitly stated by protocol that all tokens are supported, even native ETH\n> \n> @nevillehuang where is this stated?\n\nIn their docs [here](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/allo/flow-of-funds#funding-a-pool), which is part of the  contest details.\n> Pools can also be funded with either native Ether or an ERC20 token. Note though that a pool can only distribute one token, which is determined when the pool is created. Trying to call fundPool with a token other than the one used when the pool was created will cause the method to revert with an error. Pools should always be funded using the fundPool method and you should never transfer funds directly to Allo.sol\n\n**Evert0x**\n\nBased on the language in their docs it's clear that receiving native Ether is a core functionality of the protocol.\n\nStill planning to go with Medium with https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/27, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/299, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/363, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/506, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/521, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/541, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/549, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/595, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/624, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/677, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/894, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/941, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/957 as dupes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Evert0x**\n\nResult:\nMedium\nHas Duplicates \n\n**sherlock-admin2**\n\nEscalations have been resolved successfully!\n\nEscalation status:\n- [jkoppel](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-judging/issues/256/#issuecomment-1762785815): accepted\n\n",
