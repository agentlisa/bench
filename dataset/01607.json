  "Content": "# Issue H-3: PartyA and PartyB nonce is not incremented in any of the liquidation functions which can lead to all protocol funds being stolen in some cases \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical-judging/issues/190 \n\n## Found by \nbin2chen, cergyk, mstpr-brainbot, panprog, rvierdiiev, shaka, ver0759, xiaoming90\n## Summary\n\nNonce for neither partyA nor partyB is increased in any of the `LiquidationFacetImpl` functions. However, some functions definitely influence party's upnl, so they must force to use a new signature, after the liquidation action. In particular, `liquidatePositionsPartyA` function changes partyB's `allocatedBalances` and upnl, which means that partyB must be forced to use a new signature (otherwise it can use old upnl signature with new allocatedBalance, making it possible to steal all funds from the protocol):\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L169-L173\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L181-L185\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L189-L196\n\nThe same is also true for the `liquidatePartyB` function, which modifies partyA balance:\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L294-L296\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nAll liquidation functions do not change nonce of parties, however some of them change allocatedBalances, delete positions or otherwise modify the state of the parties, which requires a nonce update to force use a new signature. While many actions specifically test for liquidation status, which might be the reason why the nonce is not updated currently. However, there are still actions which ignore liquidation status and in the future there might be more functions which somehow use this changed state even during liquidation status, so the nonce update is nonetheless required when changing state during liquidation.\n\nThe Proof of Concept for this bug shows how the actions which ignore liquidation status can be used along with \"old signature\", which is accepted due to nonce being the same after the liquidation action.\n\nThe scenario to exploit this bug is as following:\n\n1. User has to control partyA, partyB and liquidator.\n2. Open 2 large opposite positions between partyA and partyB such that one of them is in a high loss and the other in the same/similar profit (easy to do via  openPrice which is far away from current market price, since both partyA and partyB are controlled by the same user).\n3. Make partyA liquidatable (many ways to do this: for example, opposite positions can have slightly different size with minimal locked balances, so that when the price moves, this disparency can make partyA liquidatable)\n4. Call `liquidatePartyA` and `setSymbolsPrice` (there is no bad debt, because 1 position is in a big loss, the other position in a big profit, but their sum is in a small loss, which is covered by allocatd balance)\n5. Sign `singleUpnlSig` for partyB at this time (partyB is in a small profit)\n6. User-controlled liquidator calls `liquidatePositionsPartyA` with id of only the position which is in a loss for partyA, profit for partyB. This call increases partyB allocated balance by a very high profit of the position. This action doesn't change partyB's nonce, so previous partyB signature is still valid (this is the bug reported here)\n7. At this time partyB has large inflated allocatedBalance and the same big loss, however signature for when partyB was in a small profit is still valid, because party B nonce is the same (position liquidation didn't change it). Use that older signature to sign `deallocateForPartyB`, deallocating inflated balance (which can easily be higher than total protocol deposited funds).\n8. Withdraw deallocated balance for partyB. At this point all protocol funds are stolen.\n\n## Impact\n\nAll protocol funds can be stolen if a user can control partyA, partyB and liquidator. Since partyB and liquidator roles are supposed to be easy to get, this means that most users are able to easily steal all protocol funds.\n\nThere might also be future functions which might ignore liquidation status and can be exploited due to nonce being the same after parties state change during liquidation.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nAdd this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`.\n\n```ts\nimport { getDummyPriceSig, getDummySingleUpnlAndPriceSig, getDummyQuotesPriceSig, getDummySingleUpnlSig } from \"./utils/SignatureUtils\";\n\nit(\"Steal all

Recommendation\n\nAdd nonce increase for both partyA and party for all liquidation functions. They might not be needed in all liquidation functions, but since they're quite tricky in parties state change, I suggest to increase nonce in all of them. However, at the very least nonce should be increased in the following functions:\n\n1. `liquidatePartyA`. Increase nonce for partyA\n2. `liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA`. Increase nonce for partyA and for all corresponding partyBs (because pending quotes are liquidated, freeing up locked balance, which is a state changing action)\n3. `liquidatePositionsPartyA`. Increase nonce for partyA and for all corresponding partyBs (because partyB allocatedBalance and upnl are changed and open position is liquidated)\n4. `liquidatePartyB`. Increase nonce for partyA and partyB (because allocatedBalance for both parties changes).\n5. `liquidatePositionsPartyB`. Increase nonce for partyA and partyB (because positions are deleted)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**hrishibhat**\n\nFix from Sponsor:\n> Fixed code PR link:\nhttps://github.com/SYMM-IO/symmio-core/pull/15\n\n",
