  "Title": "Mismatch between signature and implementation of getValueRepaid",
  "Content": "The [documented semantics](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/TermsContract.sol#L71) of `TermsContract`’s [`getValueRepaid`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/TermsContract.sol#L72) is that it returns *“the cumulative units-of-value repaid by the point at which a given blockNumber has passed”*, where `blockNumber` is one of the function arguments. Both `SimpleInterestTermsContract` and `NFTTermsContract` do not implement this semantics: they ignore the `blockNumber` argument and [return the value corresponding to the moment when the function is called](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/examples/SimpleInterestTermsContract.sol#L115). Consider either changing the interface and documentation, or implementing the documented behavior.\n\n\n***Update:** Fixed in [`6db0eee`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/commit/6db0eeee9923c91ea47d5edc6ad01342866c25b1).*\n\n\n",
