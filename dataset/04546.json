  "Content": "The [`revokeAuthorization`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol#L37) function in [`PermissionsLib`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol) removes the given address from the [`authorizedAgents`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol#L25) array. The algorithm does not correctly consider the edge case when the array is reduced from length 1 to length 0. The new array length is [correctly set to 0](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol#L45), but the address previously in the list will remain in storage, out of bounds.\n\n\nAlthough this is unlikely to cause a problem for the semantics of the contracts, consider zeroing out the last slot in the array before decrementing its length, similarly to [what](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/NonFungibleToken/blob/master/contracts/NonFungibleToken.sol#L245) [`NonFungibleToken`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/NonFungibleToken/blob/master/contracts/NonFungibleToken.sol#L245) [does](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/NonFungibleToken/blob/master/contracts/NonFungibleToken.sol#L245).\n\n\n***Update:** Fixed in [`f9ef4d9`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/commit/f9ef4d90fa5e01e7095cde1e4da85bd7f97f2a45).*\n\n\n",
