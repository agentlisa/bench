  "Title": "[H-16] Overpaying remaining gas to the user for failing `anyExecute` call due to an incorrect gas unit calculation in `BranchBridgeAgent`",
  "Content": "\nThe `anyExecute` method is called by the `Anycall Executor` on the destination chain to execute interaction. The user has to pay for the remote call `ExecutionGas`; this is done at the end of the call. However, if there is not enough `gasRemaining`, the `anyExecute` will be reverted due to a revert caused by the `Anycall Executor`.\n\nHere is the calculation for the gas used:\n\n```solidity\n\t///Save gas left\n\tuint256 gasLeft = gasleft();\n\n\t//Get Branch Environment Execution Cost\n\tuint256 minExecCost = tx.gasprice * (MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD + _initialGas - gasLeft);\n\n\t//Check if sufficient balance\n\tif (minExecCost > gasRemaining) {\n\t\t_forceRevert();\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n```\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/BranchBridgeAgent.sol#L1018-L1054>\n\n`_forceRevert` will withdraw all of the execution budget:\n\n    \t// Withdraw all execution gas budget from anycall for tx to revert with \"no enough budget\"\n    \tif (executionBudget > 0) try anycallConfig.withdraw(executionBudget) {} catch {}\n\nSo `Anycall Executor` will revert if there is not enough budget. This is done at:\n\n```solidity\n\tuint256 budget = executionBudget[_from];\n\trequire(budget > totalCost, \"no enough budget\");\n\texecutionBudget[_from] = budget - totalCost;\n```\n\n<https://github.com/anyswap/multichain-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/anycall/v7/AnycallV7Config.sol#L206C42-L206C58>\n\n### (1) Gas Calculation:\n\nTo calculate how much the user has to pay, the following formula is used:\n\n```solidity\n        //Get Branch Environment Execution Cost\n        uint256 minExecCost = tx.gasprice * (MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD + _initialGas - gasLeft);\n```\n\nGas units are calculated as follows:\n\n- Store `gasleft()` at `initialGas` at the beginning of `anyExecute` method:\n\n```solidity\n\t//Get Initial Gas Checkpoint\n\tuint256 initialGas = gasleft();\n```\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/ulysses-omnichain/BranchBridgeAgent.sol#L1125>\n\n- Nearly at the end of the method, deduct `gasleft()` from `initialGas`. This covers everything between the initial gas checkpoint and the end gas checkpoint.\n\n```solidity\n        ///Save gas left\n        uint256 gasLeft = gasleft();\n\n        //Get Branch Environment Execution Cost\n        uint256 minExecCost = tx.gasprice * (MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD + _initialGas - gasLeft);\n```\n\n- Add `MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD` which is `160_000`.\n\n```\n\n        uint256 internal constant MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD = 160_000; // 100_000 for anycall + 35_000 Pre 1st Gas Checkpoint Execution + 25_000 Post last Gas Checkpoint Executions\n\n```\n\nThis overhead is supposed to cover:\n\n- **`100_000` for `anycall`**. This is an extra cost required by `Anycall`:\n\n```solidity\nLine:38\t\nuint256 constant EXECUTION_OVERHEAD = 100000;\n\t.\n\t.\nLine:203\t\nuint256 gasUsed = _prevGasLeft + EXECUTION_OVERHEAD - gasleft();\n```\n\n<https://github.com/anyswap/multichain-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/anycall/v7/AnycallV7Config.sol#L203>\n\n- **`35_000` Pre-First Gas Checkpoint Execution**. For example, to cover the modifier `requiresExecutor`.\n\n- **`25_000` Post-Last Gas Checkpoint Execution**. To cover everything after the end gas checkpoint:\n\n```solidity\n\t//Get Branch Environment Execution Cost\n\tuint256 minExecCost = tx.gasprice * (MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD + _initialGas - gasLeft);\n\n\t//Check if sufficient balance\n\tif (minExecCost > gasRemaining) {\n\t\t_forceRevert();\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\t//Replenish Gas\n\t_replenishGas(minExecCost);\n\n\t//Transfer gas remaining to recipient\n\tSafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, gasRemaining - minExecCost);\n\n\t//Save Gas\n\tuint256 gasAfterTransfer = gasleft();\n\n\t//Check if sufficient balance\n\tif (gasLeft - gasAfterTransfer > TRANSFER_OVERHEAD) {\n\t\t_forceRevert();\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n```\n\nThe issue is, `60_000` is not enough to cover pre-first gas checkpoint and post-last gas checkpoint. This means, that the user is paying less than the actual gas cost. According to the sponsor, the `Bridge Agent` deployer deposits the first time into `anycallConfig`, where the goal is to replenish the execution budget after use every time. The issue could possibly lead to:\n\n1. Overpaying the remaining gas the user.\n2. The execution budget is decreasing over time (slow draining) in case it has funds already.\n3. The `anyExecute` calls will fail since the calculation of the gas used in the `Anycall` contracts is way bigger. In `Anycall`, this is done by the modifier `chargeDestFee`:\n\n    - modifier `chargeDestFee`:\n\n    ```solidity\n    \tmodifier chargeDestFee(address _from, uint256 _flags) {\n    \tif (_isSet(_flags, AnycallFlags.FLAG_PAY_FEE_ON_DEST)) {\n    \t\tuint256 _prevGasLeft = gasleft();\n    \t\t_;\n    \t\tIAnycallConfig(config).chargeFeeOnDestChain(_from, _prevGasLeft);\n    \t} else {\n    \t\t_;\n    \t}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    <https://github.com/anyswap/multichain-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/anycall/v7/AnycallV7Upgradeable.sol#L163-L171>\n\n    - function `chargeFeeOnDestChain`:\n\n    ```solidity\n    \tfunction chargeFeeOnDestChain(address _from, uint256 _prevGasLeft)\n    \t\texternal\n    \t\tonlyAnycallContract\n    \t{\n    \t\tif (!_isSet(mode, FREE_MODE)) {\n    \t\t\tuint256 gasUsed = _prevGasLeft + EXECUTION_OVERHEAD - gasleft();\n    \t\t\tuint256 totalCost = gasUsed * (tx.gasprice + _feeData.premium);\n    \t\t\tuint256 budget = executionBudget[_from];\n    \t\t\trequire(budget > totalCost, \"no enough budget\");\n    \t\t\texecutionBudget[_from] = budget - totalCost;\n    \t\t\t_feeData.accruedFees += uint128(totalCost);\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    ```\n\n    <https://github.com/anyswap/multichain-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/anycall/v7/AnycallV7Config.sol#L203>\n\n### (2) Gas Calculation in ``AnyCall``:\n\nThere is also a gas consumption at the `anyExec` method called by the MPC (in ``AnyCall``) here:\n\n```solidity\n    function anyExec(\n        address _to,\n        bytes calldata _data,\n        string calldata _appID,\n        RequestContext calldata _ctx,\n        bytes calldata _extdata\n    )\n        external\n        virtual\n        lock\n        whenNotPaused\n        chargeDestFee(_to, _ctx.flags) // <= starting from here\n        onlyMPC\n    {\n\t\t.\n\t\t.\n\t\t.\n\t\tbool success = _execute(_to, _data, _ctx, _extdata);\n\t\t.\n\t\t.\n   }\n```\n\n<https://github.com/anyswap/multichain-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/anycall/v7/AnycallV7Upgradeable.sol#L276>\n\nThe gas is nearly `110_000`. It is not taken into account.\n\n### (3) Base Fee & Input Data Fee:\n\nFrom [Ethereum yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf):\n\n> Gtransaction 21000 - Paid for every transaction.<br>\n> Gtxdatazero 4 - Paid for every zero byte of data or code for a transaction.<br>\n> Gtxdatanonzero 16 - Paid for every non-zero byte of data or code for a transaction.\n\nSo:\n\n1. We have `21_000` as a base fee. This should be taken into account. However, it is paid by ``AnyCall``, since the TX is sent by MPC. So, we are fine here. This probably explains the overhead (`100_000`) added by `anycall`.\n\n2. Because the `anyExecute` method has bytes data to be passed, we have extra gas consumption which is not taken into account.\n\nFor every zero byte `=>` 4.\nFor every non-zero byte `=>` 16.\n\nSo generally speaking, the bigger the data is, the bigger the gas becomes. You can simply prove this by adding arbitrary data to the `anyExecute` method in PoC #1 test below and you will see the gas spent increases.\n\n### Summary\n\n1. `MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD` is underestimated.\n2. The gas consumed by the `anyExec` method called by the MPC is not considered.\n3. Input data fee isn't taken into account.\n\nThere are two PoCs proving the first two points above. The third point can be proven by simply adding arbitrary data to the `anyExecute` method in PoC #1 test.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n### PoC #1 (`MIN_EXECUTION_OVERHEAD` is underestimated):\n\nThis PoC is independent from the codebase (but uses the same code). There are two contracts simulating `BranchBridgeAgent.anyExecute`:\n\n1. **`BranchBridgeAgent`** - which has the code of the pre-first gas checkpoint and the post-last gas checkpoint.\n2. **`BranchBridgeAgentEmpty`** - which has the code of the pre-first gas checkpoint and the post-last gas checkpoint **commented out**.\n\nWe run the same test for both, the difference in gas is what's at least nearly the minimum required to cover the pre-first gas checkpoint and the post-last gas checkpoint. In this case here it is **78097** which is bigger than `60_000`.\n\nHere is the output of the test:\n\n```sh\n[PASS] test_calcgas() (gas: 119050)\nLogs:\n  branchBridgeAgent.anyExecute Gas Spent => 92852\n\n[PASS] test_calcgasEmpty() (gas: 44461)\nLogs:\n  branchBridgeAgentEmpty.anyExecute Gas Spent => 14755\n```\n\n**`92852 - 14755` = 78097**\n\n### Explanation\n\n`BranchBridgeAgent.anyExecute` method depends on the following external calls:\n\n1. `AnycallExecutor.context()`\n2. `AnycallProxy.config()`\n3. `AnycallConfig.executionBudget()`\n4. `AnycallConfig.withdraw()`\n5. `AnycallConfig.deposit()`\n6. `WETH9.withdraw()`\n\nFor this reason, I've copied the same code from [multichain-smart-contracts](https://github.com/anyswap/multichain-smart-contracts). For WETH9, I've used the contract from the codebase which has minimal code.\n\nPlease note that:\n\n- **tx.gasprice** is replaced with a fixed value in the `_payExecutionGas` method, as it is not available in Foundry.\n- In `_replenishGas`, reading the config via `IAnycallProxy(local`AnyCall`Address).config()` is replaced with an immediate call for simplicity. In other words, avoiding a proxy to make the PoC simpler and shorter. However, if done with a proxy the gas used would increase. So in both ways, it is in favor of the PoC.\n- The condition `if (gasLeft - gasAfterTransfer > TRANSFER_OVERHEAD)` is replaced with `if (gasLeft - gasAfterTransfer > TRANSFER_OVERHEAD && false)`. This is to avoid entering the `forceRevert`. The increase of gas here is negligible.\n\n### The coded PoC\n\n- `Foundry.toml`\n\n```sh\n\t[profile.default]\n\tsolc = '0.8.17'\n\tsrc = 'solidity'\n\ttest = 'solidity/test'\n\tout = 'out'\n\tlibs =
