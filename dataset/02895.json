  "Content": "# Issue M-21: Underlying With Non-Standard Decimals Not Supported \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria-judging/issues/33 \n\n## Found by \n0x0\n\n## Summary\n\nArithmetic operations are performed with the assumption that the token always has 18 decimals.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\n[`LiquidationAccountant.claim`\n](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LiquidationAccountant.sol#L65)\n\nArithmetic operations assume the token has [18 decimals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-astaria/blob/main/src/LiquidationAccountant.sol#L78). Not all tokens use 18 decimals, such as Tether.\n\n## Impact\n\n- The addition of underlying capital that does not use 18 decimals will not be possible.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\n```solidity\nuint256 transferAmount = withdrawRatio.mulDivDown(balance, 1e18);\n```\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\n- Consider whether the addition of capital that does not use 18 decimals is desirable in the future. If it is, refactor contracts to support tokens with non-standard decimals.\n\n",
