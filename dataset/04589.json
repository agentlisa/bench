  "Content": "*(This was written for [a previous version](https://github.com/RenderToken/rendertoken/tree/fef74607fb78cdeb5e4e4eb735bccbbfe80853bd/contracts) that was audited, and it was later [fixed](https://github.com/kalinstoy/rendertoken/pull/1/commits/7dd53b9717b8a76278ef8566778b51a5ba5721ad).)*\n\n\nAs it is documented in the [comments](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.2.0/contracts/crowdsale/FinalizableCrowdsale.sol#L32), to use `FinalizableCrowdsale` you must inherit from it and define a custom `finalization` function. Instead, `finalize` was [redefined](https://github.com/RenderToken/rendertoken/blob/fef74607fb78cdeb5e4e4eb735bccbbfe80853bd/contracts/RenderTokenCrowdsale.sol#L35). Although this isn’t causing any problems in the current state of the code, the misuse of the library hinders maintainability and may cause severe problems in future revisions. Remove this function and move the extra minting to a `finalization` function.\n\n\n",
