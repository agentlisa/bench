  "Title": "Use latest version of Solidity",
  "Content": "[Current code](https://github.com/BCAPtoken/BCAPToken/blob/5cb5e76338cc47343ba9268663a915337c8b268e/sol/AbstractToken.sol#L4) is written for old versions of solc (0.4.1). With [the storage overwriting vulnerability](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/01/security-alert-solidity-variables-can-overwritten-storage/) found on versions of solc prior to 0.4.4, there’s a risk this code can be compiled with vulnerable versions. We recommend changing the solidity version pragma for the latest version (`pragma solidity ^0.4.10;`) to enforce latest compiler version to be used.\n\n\n**EDIT**: The Argon Group replied: “The pragma directive assures that no language constructions introduced after 0.4.1 are used — for the purpose of language maturity. It also allows compiling by a version up to 0.5.0 (not yet released). The current binaries are compiled with version 0.4.10. Therefore there is no risk of using a too old compiler version for this particular contract.”\n\n\n",
