  "Title": "Inflation attack on empty ticks",
  "Content": "##### Description\n\nEach AMM tick represents an empty vault, where shares are issued for collateral. A hacker can manipulate a tick so that it contains just 1 wei share and any amount of collateral. For example, suppose the hacker initially inflates the tick so that it contains 1 wei share and 1 ETH. Next, the hacker sees a victim's transaction in the mempool, which is going to deposit 20 ETH into this tick. The hacker then needs to inflate the tick to contain 1 wei share and 10 ETH + 1 wei right before the victim's transaction.\n\nHow many shares will the victim receive in this tick? The victim receives 1 wei share due to a rounding error:\n```\n1 wei share * 20 ETH / (10 ETH + 1 wei) = 1 wei share\n```\n\nNow there are 2 wei shares in total in this tick, one for the victim and one for the hacker.\n\nThe hacker then self-liquidates and receives 50% of the ether from the entire tick, which is 15 ETH, even though they initially invested 10 ETH. The profit is +5 ETH.\n\n**How does the hacker inflate the collateral in the tick?**\n\nStep 1. Before the frontrunning, the hacker ensures that the tick contains 1 share and 100+ wei ETH. They can do it using the AMM fee, performing `exchange()` back and forth. This is a heavy operation, plus there may be fees if there are other positions before the hacker's ticks. Therefore, this must be done in advance. After that the hacker self-liquidates 99% of their position, leaving one share. If there are no other positions before the hacker, they only spend money on gas.\n\nStep 2. Next, the hacker attacks themselves using an inflation attack. To do this, they perform `create_loan()+repay()` 100 times from another account. Each pass inflates the collateral by 1.5 times.\n\nHow it works:\n\nSuppose the tick currently contains 1 wei share and 106 wei collateral. The hacker deposits (106 * 2 - 1) wei collateral into the tick. How many shares will be minted?\n```\n1 wei share * (106 * 2 - 1) / 106 = 1 wei share\n```\n\nOnly 1 wei share was minted due to a rounding error.\n\nNow the tick has 2 wei shares and approximately `106 * 3` wei collateral.\n\nWhat happens when the hacker performs a full repay? They get back approximately\n```\n106 * 3 / 2 wei\n```\n\nThe tick remains with approximately the same amount: 1 wei share and `106 * 3 / 2` wei collateral.\n\nIt can be seen that one pass of `create_loan()+repay()` does not change the number of shares but increases the collateral by 1.5 times. 100 rounds can inflate the collateral from 106 wei to 42 ETH.\n\nThe test script was handed over to the customer.\n\n##### Recommendation\n\nThere are different approaches on how to solve the Inflation Attack problem. Some of the approaches along with their pros and cons, can be found in the OpenZeppelin github issue: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/3706.\n\nOne way to resolve the problem is to use virtual dead shares, as implemented in the latest OpenZeppelin ERC-4626 vault:\n* https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/51294b7480fd13e716207a621ac1d55a6290d56d/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L200\n* https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/51294b7480fd13e716207a621ac1d55a6290d56d/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L207\n\nIn case this particular fix is chosen, it is recommended to use a virtual offset of 1000 ([which is the same number used in Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L120)), as this will make the residual possibility of griefing practically unattainable.\n",

This contract extends\n * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \"shares\" token represented by this\n * contract and not the \"assets\" token which is an independent contract.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\n * with a \"donation\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation\n * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial\n * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may\n * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by\n * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as\n * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\n *\n * Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`\n * corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault\n * decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself\n * determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset\n * (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's\n * donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more\n * expensive than it is profitable. More details about the underlying math can be found\n * xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].\n *\n * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued\n * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets\n * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience\n * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the\n * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.\n *\n * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].\n * ====\n *\n * _Available since v4.7._\n */\nabstract contract ERC4626 is ERC20, IERC4626 {\n    using Math for uint256;\n\n    IERC20 private immutable _asset;\n    uint8 private immutable _underlyingDecimals;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Set the underlying asset contract.
