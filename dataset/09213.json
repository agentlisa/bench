  "Content": "_Submitted by Ruhum_\n\n[YearnTokenAdapter.sol#L13](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix/blob/main/contracts-full/adapters/yearn/YearnTokenAdapter.sol#L13)<br>\n[YearnTokenAdapter.sol#L43](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix/blob/main/contracts-full/adapters/yearn/YearnTokenAdapter.sol#L43)<br>\n\nYearnTokenAdapter allows slippage of 100% when withdrawing from the vault which will cause a loss of funds.\n\nHere's the documentation straight from the vault contract: <https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/main/contracts/Vault.vy#L1025-L1073>\nIt allows the user to specify the `maxLoss` as the last parameter. It determines how many shares can be burned to fulfill the withdrawal. Currently, the contract uses 10.000 which is 100%. Meaning there is no slippage check at all. This is bound to cause a loss of funds.\n\nI'd suggest letting the user determine the slippage check themselves instead of hardcoding it.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nCurrent `maxLoss` value: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix/blob/main/contracts-full/adapters/yearn/YearnTokenAdapter.sol#L13>\n\ncall to Yearn vault's `withdraw()` function: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix/blob/main/contracts-full/adapters/yearn/YearnTokenAdapter.sol#L43>\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nAllow the user to specify the slippage value themselves:\n\n```sol\n    function unwrap(uint256 amount, address recipient, uint maxLoss) external override returns (uint256) {\n        TokenUtils.safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n\n        uint256 balanceBefore = TokenUtils.safeBalanceOf(token, address(this));\n\n        uint256 amountWithdrawn = IYearnVaultV2(token).withdraw(amount, recipient, maxLoss);\n\n        uint256 balanceAfter = TokenUtils.safeBalanceOf(token, address(this));\n\n        // If the Yearn vault did not burn all of the shares then revert. This is critical in mathematical operations\n        // performed by the system because the system always expects that all of the tokens were unwrapped. In Yearn,\n        // this sometimes does not happen in cases where strategies cannot withdraw all of the requested tokens (an\n        // example strategy where this can occur is with Compound and AAVE where funds may not be accessible because\n        // they were lent out).\n        if (balanceBefore - balanceAfter != amount) {\n            revert IllegalState();\n        }\n\n        return amountWithdrawn;\n    }\n```\n\nIf you don't want to change the ITokenAdapter interface you can also leave the value blank. The vault will then use the default value (`0.01%`)\n\n\n**[0xfoobar (Alchemix) acknowledged, disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues/60#issuecomment-1133991312):**\n\n> This could be made more configurable by the end user but yearn vaults do not frequently experience high slippage. Slippage is handled upstream in the Alchemist contract. The reason why this slippage is set to 100% is so to permit handling of slippage in the Alchemist for all cases.\n\n**[0xleastwood (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix-findings/issues/60#issuecomment-1146206028):**\n > Because we can't know how the yearn strategy implements withdrawals, its possible that it might contain custom swap logic which exposes itself to sandwich attacks. However, at face value, the current use of `MAXIMUM_SLIPPAGE` allows the contract to successfully unwrap their tokens under poor network conditions, but it makes sense for the user to have more control over this. Downgrading this to medium risk as I believe it is more in line with that.\n\n\n\n***\n\n",

Holds an underlying token, and allows users to interact\n    with the Yearn ecosystem through Strategies connected to the Vault.\n    Vaults are not limited to a single Strategy, they can have as many Strategies\n    as can be designed (however the withdrawal queue is capped at 20.)\n\n    Deposited funds are moved into the most impactful strategy that has not\n    already reached its limit for assets under management, regardless of which\n    Strategy a user's funds end up in, they receive their portion of yields\n    generated across all Strategies.\n\n    When a user withdraws, if there are no funds sitting undeployed in the\n    Vault, the Vault withdraws funds from Strategies in the order of least\n    impact. (Funds are taken from the Strategy that will disturb everyone's\n    gains the least, then the next least, etc.) In order to achieve this, the\n    withdrawal queue's order must be properly set and managed by the community\n    (through governance).\n\n    Vault Strategies are parameterized to pursue the highest risk-adjusted yield.\n\n    There is an \"Emergency Shutdown\" mode. When the Vault is put into emergency\n    shutdown, assets will be recalled from the Strategies as quickly as is\n    practical (given on-chain conditions), minimizing loss. Deposits are\n    halted, new Strategies may not be added, and each Strategy exits with the\n    minimum possible damage to position, while opening up deposits to be\n    withdrawn by users. There are no restrictions on withdrawals above what is\n    expected under Normal Operation.\n\n    For further details, please refer to the specification:\n    https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-vaults/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md\n\"\"\"\n\nAPI_VERSION: constant(String[28]) = \"0.4.3\"\n\nfrom vyper.interfaces import ERC20\n\nimplements: ERC20\n\n\ninterface DetailedERC20:\n    def name() -> String[42]: view\n    def symbol() -> String[20]: view\n    def decimals() -> uint256: view\n\n\ninterface Strategy:\n    def want() -> address: view\n    def vault() -> address: view\n    def isActive() -> bool: view\n    def delegatedAssets() -> uint256: view\n    def estimatedTotalAssets() -> uint256: view\n    def withdraw(_amount: uint256) -> uint256: nonpayable\n    def migrate(_newStrategy: address): nonpayable\n\n\ninterface HealthCheck:\n    def check(strategy: address, profit: uint256, loss: uint256, debtPayment: uint256, debtOutstanding: uint256, totalDebt: uint256) -> bool: view\n    def doHealthCheck(strategy: address) -> bool: view\n    def enableCheck(strategy: address): nonpayable\n\nname: public(String[64])\nsymbol: public(String[32])\ndecimals: public(uint256)\n\nbalanceOf: public(HashMap[address, uint256])\nallowance: public(HashMap[address, HashMap[address, uint256]])\ntotalSupply: public(uint256)\n\ntoken: public(ERC20)\ngovernance: public(address)\nmanagement: public(address)\nguardian: public(address)\npendingGovernance: address\n\nhealthCheck: public(address)\n\nstruct StrategyParams:\n    performanceFee: uint256  #
