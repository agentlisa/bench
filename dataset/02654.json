  "Content": "# Issue M-3: The rather harsh requirement of `tokenAmount` makes it inapplicable for certain tokens \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao-judging/issues/63 \n\n## Found by \nWATCHPUG, rvierdiiev\n\n## Summary\n\nThe requirements for `tokenAmount >= stopTime - startTime` will not be suitable for all tokens and therefore need to be made less applicable for certain tokens like WBTC and EURS.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nRequiring the `tokenAmount >= stopTime - startTime` is suitable for USDC and WETH.\n\nHowever, such requirements will be a bit too harsh for other popular tokens, eg, WBTC (`decimals: 8`) and EURS (`decimals: 2`). Therefore, make the system less applicable for those tokens.\n\nFor WBTC, it must be `0.31536 WBTC` per year (worth about $5,400) to meet this requirement, and for EURS, it must be at least `315,360 EURS` per year (worth about $315,000).\n\n## Impact\n\nThe system will be inapplicable for certain tokens with higher per wei value, eg, WBTC and EURS.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao/blob/main/src/StreamFactory.sol#L200\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nConsider changing to `tokenAmount * RATE_DECIMALS_MULTIPLIER >= stopTime - startTime`.\n\n## Discussion\n\n**eladmallel**\n\nFix PR: https://github.com/nounsDAO/streamer/pull/12\n\n\n\n",
