  "Title": "External Call Is a Return Bomb Vector",
  "Content": "When a relayer executes a message, an [external call is made to the `destinationAddress`](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter/blob/253b833518aa7a6448650388cc288bd76d8470a7/contracts/src/Teleporter/TeleporterMessenger.sol#L732-L739) specified by the message sender where the amount of gas the call can use is specified in the message by the `requiredGasLimit` value. The return data from this call is not used and only the `success` of the call is recorded. Although a gas limit is set for the call, the external contract can force the transaction to use gas in excess of the specified limit due to an [open issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12306) with the Solidity compiler. This is possible because the `TeleporterMessenger` contract pays for memory expansion to accommodate the return data, but the external contract controls the size of that return data.\n\n\nConsider using assembly to explicitly prevent any memory from being allocated for the return data from the external call.\n\n\n***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #119](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter/pull/119) at commit [1de7667](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter/pull/119/commits/1de76676918d79c77084878132d17216a57a4409). However, no test case for such an exploit has been added to the test suite. Consider including a test for this kind of attack.*\n\n\n",
