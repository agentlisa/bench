  "Content": "##### Description\nAt line: https://github.com/orbxball/yfi-maker/blob/63af6fcfa536073f00d652f49befd18e429b5500/contracts/Strategy.sol#L264-L277\nthe `liquidatePosition()` function does not take into account the value of the`_loss` variable accounting in `prepareReturn()` function. In this case the `liquidatePosition()` function will always return `_liquidatedAmount = _amountNeeded` excluding losses.\nThis implementation may lead to revert when the Vault call the function `withdraw` function (at line https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/952b767fcd597fac8aa2cf5d023532d150bb9236/contracts/BaseStrategy.sol#L681) by reason of the insufficient balance. \n  \nAlso the withdrawer from vault should incur the losses from liquidation caused by his own withdrawal. However, the [liquidatePosition()](https://github.com/orbxball/yfi-maker/blob/63af6fcfa536073f00d652f49befd18e429b5500/contracts/Strategy.sol#L264) is ignoring any losses from underlying DAI vault. This may lead to improper accounting of user balances and possible locking of vault withdrawals.  \n  \n##### Recommendation\nIt is recommended to rewrite logic of `liquidatePosition()`  considering the losses.\n",
