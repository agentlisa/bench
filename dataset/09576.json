If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will contain a point of failure on the original `lend()` call.\n\nIt is my belief that this is a medium severity vulnerability due to its ability to impact core protocol functionality.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nFor the first lender to call `lend()`, if the transfer fee % of the asset token is larger than the origination fee %, the second transfer will fail in the following code:\n\n```solidity\nERC20(loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);\nuint256 facilitatorTake = amount * originationFeeRate / SCALAR;\nERC20(loanAssetContractAddress).safeTransfer(\n    IERC721(borrowTicketContract).ownerOf(loanId),\n    amount - facilitatorTake\n);\n```\n\nExample:\n\n*   `originationFee = 2%` Max fee is 5% per comments\n\n*   `feeOnTransfer = 3%`\n\n*   `amount = 100 tokens`\n\n*   Lender transfers `amount`\n\n*   `NFTLoanFacilitator` receives `97`.\n\n*   `facilitatorTake = 2`\n\n*   `NFTLoanFacilitator` attempts to send `100 - 2` to borrower, but only has `97`.\n\n*   Execution reverts.\n\n#### Other considerations:\n\nIf the originationFee is less than or equal to the transferFee, the transfers will succeed but will be received at a loss for the borrower and lender. Specifically for the lender, it might be unwanted functionality for a lender to lend 100 and receive 97 following a successful repayment (excluding interest for this example).\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nSince the `originationFee` is calculated based on the `amount` sent by the lender, this calculation will always underflow given the example above. Instead, a potential solution would be to calculate the `originationFee` based on the requested loan amount, allowing the lender to send a greater value so that `feeOnTransfer <= originationFee`.\n\nOppositely, the protocol can instead calculate the amount received from the initial transfer and use this amount to calculate the `originationFee`. The issue with this option is that the borrower will receive less than the desired loan amount.\n\n\n**[wilsoncusack (Backed Protocol) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed-findings/issues/75#issuecomment-1091897047):**\n > If `amount - origination_fee - token_fee < 0`, then yeah you will not be able to underwrite to loan. But that would be a huge fee.\n\n**[wilsoncusack (Backed Protocol) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed-findings/issues/75#issuecomment-1091903599):**\n > Discussed more with warden 0xDjango, if the token even has a 1% fee then the second transfer will fail OR we will leak facilitator funds, although this is sort of impossible because currently none of the transactions with these fee on transfer tokens will work.\n\n**[wilsoncusack (Backed Protocol) acknowledged and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed-findings/issues/75#issuecomment-1092316654):**\n> This issue is slightly different from others that just point out that borrowers will get `amount - token_fee`. The only one I have seen, I think, to point out that fulfilling loans with fee on transfer tokens is impossible.<br>\n>\n> Imagine a token that takes 1% on transfer.<br>\n> Amount = 100<br>\n> 99 reaches facilitator<br>\n> facilitator transfers 100 - facilitator take = 99 to the borrower.<br>\n> Facilitator gets nothing<br>\n> Borrower gets 98.<br>\n> \n> If the facilitator take is greater or the fee on transfer take is greater, it won't work at all.<br>\n> \n> Med severity is maybe right given we can miss out on origination fees?\n\n**[wilsoncusack (Backed Protocol) confirmed and resolved](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed-findings/issues/75#issuecomment-1097469936)**\n\n**[gzeon (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed-findings/issues/75#issuecomment-1100083163):**\n > Sponsor confirmed with fix.\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
