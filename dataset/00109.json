  "Content": "# Issue M-14: Liquidation does not prioritize lowest LTV tokens \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model-judging/issues/155 \n\nThe protocol has acknowledged this issue.\n\n## Found by \n0x73696d616f, santiellena\n## Summary\nThe protocol does not prioritize repayment of debt in partial liquidations in the lowest Loan-To-Value tokens which leads to inefficient liquidations in which health factor because the average Risk-Adjust Factor is not improved and puts the protocol in bad debt and a liquidation crisis risk. \n## Vulnerability Detail\nAt the moment of calculating the health factor, the user's collateral balance (in `ETH`) is multiplied by each asset's adjust factor and divided by the user's debt which is also divided by this adjust factor. \n\nWhen liquidations are triggered, the liquidator decides in which asset the borrower will pay (choosing the seize market). However, there are not checks to see if that seize will improve health factor. When the borrower is collateralized through multiple assets, its borrowing power depends on the amount of collateral deposited and the average Risk-Adjust factor of all deposited assets. If a liquidator lowers this average Risk-Adjust factor by using as seize market the one that has the highest LTV asset in the borrower basket, the health factor of the borrower will decrease or not improve letting the liquidator liquidate the borrower again.\n\nA precise mathematical explanation of how it works can be found on the [math paper](https://docs.exact.ly/resources/math-paper#id-6.-liquidations):\n![[risk-adjust-factor-exactly.png]]\n\nFor example, let's say we deposited: 100 ETH of value in DAI with an adjusted factor of 0.9; 100 ETH of value in ETH with an adjusted factor of 0.3.  Then, we borrow 42 ETH in DAI and 21 ETH in ETH. Consider at this point just for the practical example that the value of DAI is 2 ETH.\n\n- The adjusted collateral will be equal to: `100*0.9 + 100*0.3 = 120`\n- The adjusted debt will be equal to: `42/0.9 + 21/0.3 = 116.66\n- The health factor will be equal to: `120/116.66 = 1.02`\n\nThe price of DAI drops and its value now is 1 ETH and now we have the same amount of debt in each asset (21 ETH in DAI and 30 ETH in ETH).\n\n- The adjusted collateral will be equal to: `50*0.9 + 100*0.3 = 75`\n- The adjusted debt will be equal to: `21/0.9 + 21/0.3 = 93.33`\n- The health factor will be equal to: `75/93.33 = 0.80`\n\nPartial liquidation can be triggered in two ways:\n1) Clearing the borrower DAI debt\n\tThis means that the token minted by the market that has DAI as underlying asset will be burned from the borrower account (the actual calculation process is a little bit different but the concept is the same).\n\t\n\tBurning 21 ETH in value of DAI (at this point the conversion is 1:1) taking into account liquidator fee:\n\t - The adjusted collateral will be equal to: `(29 - 21*0.05)*0.9 + 100*0.3 = 55.15`\n\t - The adjusted debt will be equal to: `21/0.3 = 70`\n\t - The health factor will be equal to: `55.15/70 = 0.78`\n\n2) Clearing the borrower ETH debt\n\tBurning 21 ETH in value of ETH (at this point the conversion is 1:1) taking into account liquidator fee:\n\t - The adjusted collateral will be equal to: `50*0.9 + (79 - 21*0.05)*0.3 = 68.38`\n\t - The adjusted debt will be equal to: `21/0.9 = 23.33`\n\t - The health factor will be equal to: `68.68/23.33 = 2.93`\n\nIn the case N°1, a minimized example of what occurs in the liquidation process is shown. However, for a more precise example refer to the PoC and to the math paper: https://docs.exact.ly/resources/math-paper#id-6.-liquidations. Liquidations should always improve the Heath Factor.\n\nA conceptual (not exact) explanation of this vulnerability: https://youtu.be/AD2IF8ovE-w?si=nUgUn5berQdDgRN2&t=1884.\n\nGiven this scenario, in Exactly, the liquidator decides which asset the borrower will use to pay the debt. In this protocol and in many others, the possibility to execute partial liquidations is introduced to return the account to solvency as fast as possible and involve the least liquidation possible. The problem with this is that the protocol is allowing liquidators to lower the Health Factor of borrowers unnecessarily, benefiting liquidators and harming the borrower and the protocol, even putting the protocol in risk of a [liquidation crisis](https://medium.com/coinmonks/what-is-liquidation-in-defi-lending-and-borrowing-platforms-3326e0ba8d0).\n\nHealth factor after liquidations should always improve.\n\n**Proof of Concept/Code:** \nAdd `import { console } from \"forge-std/console.sol\"` to `test/Market.t.sol`\n\nAdd the following test on `test/Market.t.sol`\n```solidity\nfunction testLiquidationDoesntImproveHealthFactor() public {\n    // modify adjust factor from set up\n    auditor.setAdjustFactor(marketWETH, 0.3e18); // risk factor for some volatile asset e.g OP\n    auditor.setAdjustFactor(market, 0.9e18); // risk factor for some stablecoin\n\n    // providing some liquidity\n    marketWETH.deposit(100_000 ether, address(this));\n    market.deposit(100_000 ether, address(this));\n\n    assertEq(market.balanceOf(ALICE), 0);\n    assertEq(marketWETH.balanceOf(ALICE), 0);\n\n    // adding collateral to borrower account (ALICE)\n    market.deposit(15_000 ether, ALICE);\n    marketWETH.deposit(15_000 ether, ALICE);\n\n    assertEq(market.balanceOf(ALICE), 15_000 ether);\n    assertEq(marketWETH.balanceOf(ALICE), 15_000 ether);\n\n    // entering both markets so when checking account liquidity both deposits are considered\n    vm.startPrank(ALICE);\n    auditor.enterMarket(marketWETH);\n    auditor.enterMarket(market);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    // setting DAI price to twice the price of ETH so then it drops and the value is the same\n    // (just to make calculations easier)\n    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(2e18);\n\n    // taking some debt in both assets\n    vm.startPrank(ALICE);\n    marketWETH.borrow(4000 ether, ALICE, ALICE);\n    market.borrow(8000 ether, ALICE, ALICE);\n    vm.stopPrank();\n\n    // DAI price drops, ALICE is liquidatable\n    daiPriceFeed.setPrice(1e18);\n    \n    (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt) = auditor.accountLiquidity(ALICE, Market(address(0)), 0);\n    uint256 healthFactorBefore = (collateral * 1e18) / debt;\n\n   // ALICE is liquidated and the seize market is the highest LTV asset\n    vm.prank(BOB);\n    market.liquidate(ALICE, 6000 ether, market); // @audit-info changing the seize market to WETH will make the HF go up\n\n    (collateral, debt) = auditor.accountLiquidity(ALICE, Market(address(0)), 0);\n    uint256 healthFactorAfter = (collateral * 1e18) / debt;\n\n    console.log(\"Balance market after liq: \", market.balanceOf(ALICE));\n    console.log(\"Balance marketweth after liq: \", marketWETH.balanceOf(ALICE));\n\n    console.log(\"HF Before:\", healthFactorBefore);\n    console.log(\"HF After:\", healthFactorAfter);\n\n    // HEALTH FACTOR NOT IMPROVED!!!\n    assert(healthFactorBefore >= healthFactorAfter);\n  }\n```\n## Impact\nLiquidators could unfairly liquidate borrowers no improving their health factor to liquidate them again. The protocol is at risk of a liquidation crisis. \n## Code Snippet\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L538-L614\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Auditor.sol#L195-L255\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n## Recommendation\nAdd a check in the `liquidate` function to ensure that the health factor is improved after liquidation. A view function could be added so liquidators can check which markets can be used as seize market. However, addressing this issue can be complicated and could involve design decisions that I am not the one to propose.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**0x73696d616f**\n\nEscalate\n\nThis is not a duplicate of #117. It does not identify that the adjusted factor is not adjusted for the repay and seize market. Even if you pick the lowest LTV token, the resulting target health will not be 1.25, as the math is not accounting for the picked repay and seize markets.\n\n**sherlock-admin3**\n\n> Escalate\n> \n> This is not a duplicate of #117.

After that, the escalation becomes final.\n\n**santiellena**\n\nCompletely agree with @0x73696d616f\n\n**santipu03**\n\n> This is not a duplicate of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model-judging/issues/117. It does not identify that the adjusted factor is not adjusted for the repay and seize market. Even if you pick the lowest LTV token, the resulting target health will not be 1.25, as the math is not accounting for the picked repay and seize markets.\n\nAccording to your comment [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model-judging/issues/116#issuecomment-2117211593), this issue should be a dup of #117 because the root cause is that a borrower has collateral in several markets but the liquidator can only choose one of them to seize/repay. \n\n**0x73696d616f**\n\n>  By the same rule, it should also be a duplicate of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model-judging/issues/117 right? All three root causes are that a borrower has collateral in several markets but a liquidator can only pick one of them to seize/repay.\n\nThis would be true if the rest of the comment also applied here, which is not the case. What I mean by the root cause being having several markets is that both #155 and #116 are strictly attributing as root cause this fact. So while #117 would not happen if there was a single market, ultimately this is not its root cause. #117 attributes the root cause to the incorrect math consideration of not adjusting the average health factor to the adjust factor of the markets to repay and seize. This becomes clear after realizing that the fix for #155 fixes #116, but does not fix #117.\n\n#155 and #116 -> implement cross market liquidations and both are fixed. Or, as #155 suggested, accept this risk but check the post liquidation health factor. This will ensure/mitigate neither the liquidator/protocol take losses (as explained in #155) nor the borrower takes advantage of this (#116).\n\n#117 -> Adjust the health factor to the seize and repay markets, which will ensure that the target health is always 1.25. Neither reports mention a single word about this.\n\nThis is the dupping that makes sense.\n\n**santipu03**\n\nI agree that #155 and #117 have different root causes and #116 should be a duplicate of #155. \n\n**cvetanovv**\n\nI agree with the comments. Because of the different root causes, I will remove the duplication with #117.\n\nPlanning to accept the escalation and remove the duplication with #117. Also, #116 would be a duplicate of this issue.\n\n**Evert0x**\n\nResult:\nMedium\nHas Duplicates\n\n**sherlock-admin4**\n\nEscalations have been resolved successfully!\n\nEscalation status:\n- [0x73696d616f](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model-judging/issues/155/#issuecomment-2117211375): accepted\n\n",
