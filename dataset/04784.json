  "Content": "\n### Proof of Concept\n\nBased on documentations on how genesis upgrades should work, the transaction is to return the hash of the L2 system contract upgrade transaction after it's execution.\n\nNow, take a look at https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-zksync/blob/4f0ba34f34a864c354c7e8c47643ed8f4a250e13/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/upgrades/BaseZkSyncUpgradeGenesis.sol#L46-L68\n\n```solidity\n\n    function upgrade(ProposedUpgrade calldata _proposedUpgrade) public virtual override returns (bytes32) {\n        // Note that due to commitment delay, the timestamp of the L2 upgrade batch may be earlier than the timestamp\n        // of the L1 block at which the upgrade occurred. This means that using timestamp as a signifier of \"upgraded\"\n        // on the L2 side would be inaccurate. The effects of this \"back-dating\" of L2 upgrade batches will be reduced\n        // as the permitted delay window is reduced in the future.\n        require(block.timestamp >= _proposedUpgrade.upgradeTimestamp, \"Upgrade is not ready yet\");\n\n        _setNewProtocolVersion(_proposedUpgrade.newProtocolVersion);\n        _upgradeL1Contract(_proposedUpgrade.l1ContractsUpgradeCalldata);\n        _upgradeVerifier(_proposedUpgrade.verifier, _proposedUpgrade.verifierParams);\n        _setBaseSystemContracts(_proposedUpgrade.bootloaderHash, _proposedUpgrade.defaultAccountHash);\n\n        bytes32 txHash = _setL2SystemContractUpgrade(\n            _proposedUpgrade.l2ProtocolUpgradeTx,\n            _proposedUpgrade.factoryDeps,\n            _proposedUpgrade.newProtocolVersion\n        );\n\n        _postUpgrade(_proposedUpgrade.postUpgradeCalldata);\n\n        emit UpgradeComplete(_proposedUpgrade.newProtocolVersion, txHash, _proposedUpgrade);\n    }\n```\n\nThis function is an overriden one of the inherited `BaseZkSyncUpgrade.upgrade()`, case here is that unlike the inherited version where the bytes data to be returned [has been explicitly mentioned as `txHash`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-zksync/blob/4f0ba34f34a864c354c7e8c47643ed8f4a250e13/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/upgrades/BaseZkSyncUpgrade.sol#L67), this function does not explicitly name the variable to be returned, leading to all attempts of calling this function to return `0`.\n\n### Minimalistic POC\n\nDeploying this contract on remix proves this bug case\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity 0.8.20;\n\ncontract BaseContract {\n    function upgrade(bytes memory _proposedUpgrade) public virtual pure returns (bytes32 txHash) {\ntxHash = bytes32(abi.encodePacked(_proposedUpgrade));\n }\n}\n\ncontract BaseContractGenesis is BaseContract {\n\n\n    function upgrade(bytes memory _proposedUpgrade) public override pure returns (bytes32) {\n\n        bytes32 txHash = bytes32(abi.encodePacked(_proposedUpgrade));\n\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nPassing the value: `0x212226`.\n\nWe can see that:\n\n- `BaseContract.upgrade()` returns `0: bytes32: txHash 0x2122260000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, &\n- `BaseContractGenesis.upgrade()` returns `0: bytes32: txHash 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n\nAnd this happens despite both functions having the same implementation.\n\n### Impact\n\nBorderline low/medium, cause whereas genesis upgrades do not work as expected, we can't seem to find a direct instance where the expected hash being returned is implemented in protocol.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nName the variable to be returned as is done in [BaseZkSyncUpgrade.upgrade()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-zksync/blob/4f0ba34f34a864c354c7e8c47643ed8f4a250e13/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/upgrades/BaseZkSyncUpgrade.sol#L67) or attach the `return` at the end of the function's execution, i.e apply these changes to: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-zksync/blob/4f0ba34f34a864c354c7e8c47643ed8f4a250e13/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/upgrades/BaseZkSyncUpgradeGenesis.sol#L46-L68\n\n```diff\n\n-    function upgrade(ProposedUpgrade calldata _proposedUpgrade) public virtual override returns (bytes32) {\n+    function upgrade(ProposedUpgrade calldata _proposedUpgrade) public virtual override returns (bytes32 txHash) {\n        // Note that due to commitment delay, the timestamp of the L2 upgrade batch may be earlier than the timestamp\n        // of the L1 block at which the upgrade occurred. This means that using timestamp as a signifier of \"upgraded\"\n        // on the L2 side would be inaccurate. The effects of this \"back-dating\" of L2 upgrade batches will be reduced\n        // as the permitted delay window is reduced in the future.\n        require(block.timestamp >= _proposedUpgrade.upgradeTimestamp, \"Upgrade is not ready yet\");\n\n        _setNewProtocolVersion(_proposedUpgrade.newProtocolVersion);\n        _upgradeL1Contract(_proposedUpgrade.l1ContractsUpgradeCalldata);\n        _upgradeVerifier(_proposedUpgrade.verifier, _proposedUpgrade.verifierParams);\n        _setBaseSystemContracts(_proposedUpgrade.bootloaderHash, _proposedUpgrade.defaultAccountHash);\n\n        bytes32 txHash = _setL2SystemContractUpgrade(\n            _proposedUpgrade.l2ProtocolUpgradeTx,\n            _proposedUpgrade.factoryDeps,\n            _proposedUpgrade.newProtocolVersion\n        );\n\n        _postUpgrade(_proposedUpgrade.postUpgradeCalldata);\n\n        emit UpgradeComplete(_proposedUpgrade.newProtocolVersion, txHash, _proposedUpgrade);\n    }\n```\n\n**Additional Note**\n\n> Depending on the judge's stance of either looking at this as \"breaking core functionality\" or \"ignorable miss in `code/docs`\" determines the final valididty as we assume the former puts this report on the grounds of a `medium`.\n\n",
