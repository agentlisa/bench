  "Content": "\nLack of support for ERC1155 NFT so a vast amount of popular ERC1155 NFT cannot be used as collateral to borrow fund.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nAccording to the documentation:\n\nhttps://docs.astaria.xyz/docs/faq#what-nfts-will-i-be-able-to-borrow-against\n\n> At launch, Astaria plans to support terms for leading NFT collections through its whitelisted strategist partners. Smaller collections may be supported at the discretion of individual whitelisted strategists, or by PrivateVaults.\n\nThe codebase use ERC721 safeTransferFrom extensively and assume that the underlyling NFT contract conforms to ERC721 standard.\n\nIn ClearingHouse.sol, the function below is used when flashAction is used \n\n```solidity\nClearingHouse(s.clearingHouse[collateralId]).transferUnderlying(\n  addr,\n  tokenId,\n  address(receiver)\n);\n\n//trigger the flash action on the receiver\nif (\n  receiver.onFlashAction(\n\tIFlashAction.Underlying(s.clearingHouse[collateralId], addr, tokenId),\n\tdata\n  ) != keccak256(\"FlashAction.onFlashAction\")\n) {\n  revert FlashActionCallbackFailed();\n}\n```\n\nwhich calls the code below that use ERC721(tokenContract).safeTransferFrom\n\n```solidity\n  function transferUnderlying(\n    address tokenContract,\n    uint256 tokenId,\n    address target\n  ) external {\n    IAstariaRouter ASTARIA_ROUTER = IAstariaRouter(_getArgAddress(0));\n    require(msg.sender == address(ASTARIA_ROUTER.COLLATERAL_TOKEN()));\n    ERC721(tokenContract).safeTransferFrom(address(this), target, tokenId);\n  }\n```\n\nand in CollateralToken.sol the function onERC721Received hook, the code needs to transfer the NFT from collateralToken to clearing house.\n\n```solidity\nERC721(msg.sender).safeTransferFrom(\n\taddress(this),\n\ts.clearingHouse[collateralId],\n\ttokenId_\n);\n```\n\nHowever, there are popular NFT, that conform to ERC1155 standard,\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tokens-nft1155\n\nwhich use safeTransferFrom in ERC1155 implementation and does not match ERC721 safeTransferFrom method call\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d59306bd06a241083841c2e4a39db08e1f3722cc/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L114\n\n```solidity\nfunction safeTransferFrom(\n\taddress from,\n\taddress to,\n\tuint256 id,\n\tuint256 amount,\n\tbytes memory data\n) public virtual override {\n```\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nWe recommend the protocol support ERC1155 transfer as well given the vast popular ERC1155 NFT in NFT community and NFT marketplace.\n\n\n",
