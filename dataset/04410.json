  "Title": "[L07] Potential division by zero",
  "Content": "The [`balanceDecreaseAllowed` function](https://gitlab.com/aave-tech/dlp/contracts/blob/1f8e5e65a99a887a5a13ad9af6486ebf93f57d02/contracts/lendingpool/LendingPoolDataProvider.sol#L160) in the `LendingPoolDataProvider` contract is used to validate decreases in an account’s collateral balance. Once it [calculates the collateral balance after the decrease](https://gitlab.com/aave-tech/dlp/contracts/blob/1f8e5e65a99a887a5a13ad9af6486ebf93f57d02/contracts/lendingpool/LendingPoolDataProvider.sol#L192), the function computes the resulting liquidation threshold. However, in this last calculation [the new collateral balance is used as a divisor](https://gitlab.com/aave-tech/dlp/contracts/blob/1f8e5e65a99a887a5a13ad9af6486ebf93f57d02/contracts/lendingpool/LendingPoolDataProvider.sol#L197) without previously validating whether it is zero.\n\n\nWhile this does not pose a security issue, since the [`div` function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.3.0/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol#L83) of OpenZeppelin `SafeMath` is used, it should be noted that the division by zero will cause the transaction to revert with an unexpected and not user-friendly error message from the `SafeMath` library. Therefore, to avoid unexpected behaviors, consider returning `false` if the `collateralBalancefterDecrease` variable is zero.\n\n\n**Update**: *Fixed in [MR#85](https://gitlab.com/aave-tech/dlp/contracts/merge_requests/85/diffs).*\n\n\n",
