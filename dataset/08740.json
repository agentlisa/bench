  "Content": "\nContext: [OwnerProxy.sol#L21-L36](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/governance/OwnerProxy.sol#L21-L36), [OperatorScripts.sol#L58-L60](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-nested/blob/main/contracts/governance/scripts/OperatorScripts.sol#L58-L60)\n\n### Description:\nsolhint is useful to help ignore warnings that aren't really issues. For example the code base has some assembly blocks which promts the warning `Linter: Avoid to use inline assembly. It is acceptable only in rare cases`. Adding in `/* solhint-disable no-inline-assembly */` above it will ignore this warning.\n\n### Recommendation\nUse solhint to ignore warnings that aren't really issues.\n\n**maximebrugel (Nested) responded:**\n > **OK:**\n * [L-01] Known vulnerabilities exist in currently used @openzeppelin/contracts version\n * [L-02] Impractical Entry/Exit fees are allowed\n * [L-03] poolCoinAmount validation**\n * [L-04] Low level calls with solidity version 0.8.14 can result in optimiser bug.\n * [L-05] Unchecked return value of transferFrom can allow a user to withdraw native token for free.\n * [N-01] Missing checks for `address(0x0)` when assigning values to address state variables\n * [N-02] Adding a return statement when the function defines a named return variable, is redundant\n * [N-03] Public functions not called by the contract should be declared external instead\n * [N-04] NatSpec is incomplete\n * [N-06] Typos\n * [N-07] Lack of Event Emission For Critical Functions\n * [N-09] Missing selector check on operator\n * [N-10] Unused imports\n * [N-12] Add `namesLength > 0` check in `areOperatorsImported()` method\n * [N-13] Libraries, interfaces, and external imports can be ordered nicely\n * [N-15] Consider using IERC20 type instead of address.\n * [N-17] Naming inconsistency - some arguments have `_` at their prefixes but others do not at NestedFactory.sol\n * [N-18] Use either `_msgSender()` or `msg.sender`\n * [N-19] `OwnerProxy` can call `selfdestruct()`\n * [N-20] A magic number should be documented and explained. Use a constant instead\n\n> **Acknowledged:**\n * [N-05] Event is missing indexed fields\n * [N-08] Too Recent of a Pragma\n * [N-11] Change your imports\n * [N-14] Consider checking the recipient address for existence before making the call\n * [N-16] setMaxAllowance should be called in the constructor\n\n> **Not an Issue for Us:**\n * [N-21] Lack of solhint To Ignore Warnings\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
