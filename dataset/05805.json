  "Title": "[M-01] AfEth collaterals cannot be balanced after ratio is changed",
  "Content": "\nThe AfEth ratio between the collaterals can be modified but there is no direct way to balance the assets to follow the new ratio.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe AfEth contract contains a configurable parameter `ratio` that indicates the intended balance between the two collaterals, SafEth and the Votium strategy. For example, a value of `3e17` means that 30% of the TVL should go to SafEth, and 70% should go to Votium.\n\nThis ratio is followed when new deposits are made. The deposited ETH is splitted according to the ratio and channeled in proportion to each collateral. The ratio is also checked when rewards are deposited to direct them to the proper collateral.\n\nThe ratio can also be modified by the admins of the protocol using the `setRatio()` function.\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/AfEth.sol#L90-L92>\n\n```solidity\n90:     function setRatio(uint256 _newRatio) public onlyOwner {\n91:         ratio = _newRatio;\n92:     }\n```\n\nHowever, there is no way to balance the assets once a new ratio is defined. The implementation will need to rely on new deposits and reward compounding to slowly correct the offset, which may take a lot of time and may be impractical for most cases.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nLet's assume the protocol is deployed with a ratio of `3e17`.\n\n1.  Deposits follow the configured ratio and split the TVL in 30% for SafEth and 70% for Votium.\n2.  At some point, the protocol decides to switch to 50%-50% and sets a new ratio of `5e17`.\n3.  New deposits will follow the new ratio and split 50% for each collateral, but these have potentially accumulated a large amount of TVL with the previous split. The existing difference will continue, new deposits can't correct this offset.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nSimilar to how it is done in SafEth, the AfEth contract could have a rebalancing function which withdraws the proper amount from one collateral and deposits it in the other collateral, in order to correct the offset and target the new configured ratio. This function should be admin controlled, and support slippage control to correctly handle potentially large amounts of swaps.\n\nAn alternative could be to also correct a potential deviation in the ratio using new deposits. This could help speed up the correction by not only relying on rewards, but will also endure a delay in the convergence.\n\n**[elmutt (Asymmetry) acknowledged, but disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry-findings/issues/55#issuecomment-1747051030):**\n > It's hard to rebalance because of the locked convex. We have discussed this internally and consider it an acceptable risk for now so im acknowledging this issue instead of confirming.\n\n**[0xleastwood (Judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry-findings/issues/55#issuecomment-1751706361):**\n > In this instance, the implementation of the ratio mechanism with respect to rebalancing between `vEth` and `safEth` is a design decision that has flaws and potentially needs to be redesigned. However, the warden has identified that the current implementation does not enforce the ratio as what might be expected from users. For example, once the ratio has been changed, it takes some time for this to be fully in effect and as a result, users may be depositing into the protocol with the expectation of some ratio but that isn't what is currently in place. Performing instant rebalances is a design decision done by `safEth` so maybe this is the right way to be consistent? Even if users are potentially retroactively affected, provided the delay is sufficient, users should be able to exit the protocol if they do not agree with the new ratio.\n> \n> For these reasons, I would still like to keep this issue as medium severity because I think this mechanism is ultimately flawed and can be realistically improved. My decision is final on this.\n\n\n***\n\n",
