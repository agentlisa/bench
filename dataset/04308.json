  "Title": "[L02] Externally-owned accounts can be registered as contracts in Finder contract",
  "Content": "The [`changeImplementationAddress` function](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Finder.sol#L24) of the `Finder` contract is a privileged function (only called by the `owner` address) in charge of registering contract addresses under a given interface name. However, while the function is only intended to register contract addresses, there is currently no validation on whether the address provided is actually a contract.\n\n\nWhile this issue does not pose a security risk, consider using the [`isContract` function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.0.0-beta.0/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L24) of OpenZeppelin’s `Address` utility library to ensure the address being registered is indeed a contract.\n\n\n**Update:** *The issue is acknowledged, but the implementation will remain unchanged. Addressing the issue would introduce an unnecessary burden on existing token holders to migrate to a new contract.*\n\n\n",
