  "Title": "[M-19] Silent overflow could alter computation when calculating the `vaultPortion` in the `PrizePool` contract",
  "Content": "\nIf an overflow happens, the computed value of the vault portion will be a totally different value than what should really be; which would end up causing the rewards to disperse and be lower for the draw that was used to compute the vault portion.\n\nNote: Even though [the bot reported issues about downcasting variables](https://gist.github.com/itsmetechjay/e7fd03943bbacff1984a33b9f89c4149#low-4-use-safecast-to-safely-downcast-variables), it didn't mention this specific unsafe casting; which if an overflow occurs, could cause a huge impact on the calculation of the vault portions.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nWhen computing the `vaultPortion` to the PrizePool over a specific duration in draw, the values of the [`vaultContributed`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-prize-pool/blob/4bc8a12b857856828c018510b5500d722b79ca3a/src/PrizePool.sol#L963-L968) & [`totalContributed`](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-prize-pool/blob/4bc8a12b857856828c018510b5500d722b79ca3a/src/PrizePool.sol#L951-L956) variables are computed on the `DrawAccumulatorLib` library, and [they are computed and returned as `uint256` values.](https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-prize-pool/blob/4bc8a12b857856828c018510b5500d722b79ca3a/src/libraries/DrawAccumulatorLib.sol#L166-L307)\n\nThe issue is, that in the `PrizePool::_getVaultPortion()` the `vaultContributed` & `totalContributed` variables are unsafely cast from uint256 to int256, which could lead to a silent overflow if any of the two original values don't fit on an `int256`.\n\nAs a result of a silent overflow, the computed value of the vault portion will be a totally different value than what should really be; which would end up causing the rewards to disperse and be lower for the draw that was used to compute the vault portion.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nMake sure to implement a safe cast that checks if overflows occur to prevent computing a totally different value than what it should really be. Use `OZ safeCast` library for this type of operation.\n\n### Assessed type\n\nUnder/Overflow\n\n**[asselstine (PoolTogether) confirmed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-pooltogether-findings/issues/243#issuecomment-1642897877):**\n > The `DrawAccumulator` stores the available balance as `uint96`, but we could definitely tighten up the data types and make casting safe.\n\n**[PoolTogether mitigated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-pooltogether-mitigation#individual-prs):**\n> Added SafeCast.<br>\n> PR: https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-prize-pool/pull/22\n\n**Status**: Mitigation confirmed.
