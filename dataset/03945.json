  "Title": "[C01] Funds of the Escrow contract can be locked by anyone",
  "Content": "The [`Escrow` contract](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L14) allows users to send payments to other users who do not yet have a public and private key pair or an address.  \n\nGiven two different actors, Alice and Bob, with Alice being a current participant of the Celo protocol and Bob a person who does not possess Celo Gold, Alice could use the [`transfer` function](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L84-L116) to send a payment to Bob to an address specified in the [`paymentId` parameter](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L89). This `paymentId` is used to save in storage the state of the whole process in the [`escrowedPayments` mapping](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L101).  \n\nTo withdraw the amount of money Alice has sent him, Bob uses the [`withdraw` function](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L127-L162), which is in charge of recovering from storage the state of the payment into the [`payment` variable](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L134) and after validating that the transaction is correct, it [sends the funds to Bob’s address](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L151).\n\n\nNevertheless, as there is not any validation on whether the `paymentId` has been used before to generate another transfer, it is possible for anyone to call a second time the `transfer` function with the same `paymentId` as the initial one and [overwrite the storage](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L101) of that transaction before anyone uses the `withdraw` function to claim the funds. This will result in the lock of the user’s funds in the `Escrow` contract. When the victim tries to use the `withdraw` function, the retrieved state of `paymentId` will only correspond to the second transfer.\n\n\nConsider modifying the logic of the contract to be able to handle multiple escrows for a specific `paymentId`. Alternatively, consider preventing the creation of an escrow that will overwrite an existing escrow.\n\n\n***Update:** Fixed in [pull request #2797](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/2797). The [transfer now reverts if the `paymentId` has been used before](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/2797/files#diff-fc1539c9a5f586cafd563ecbfbd2cb36R102). A regression unit test was added in [pull request #3351](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/3351/files#diff-98e2c5b79b4dd0cabb54febef4e67675R174).*\n\n\n",
