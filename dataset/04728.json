  "Title": "[H-02] Dual transaction nature of composed message transfer allows anyone to steal user funds",
  "Content": "\nSending OFTs with a composed message via LayerZero V2 involves 2 transactions on the destination chain (Canto) according to the [documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart#optional-\\_composedmsg) (see also [README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/README.md?plain=1#L199)):\n\n1.  Receiving: The LayerZero endpoint receives the message and processes the OFT transfer to the `ASDRouter` contract.\n2.  Executing: Since the message is composed, it's *permissionlessly* processed by an executor who invokes the [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) method of the `ASDRouter` contract.\n\nThe above steps are processed in separate transactions (not atomic) and step 2 requires the OFTs [to be already transferred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/README.md?plain=1#L89) to the `ASDRouter` contract.\n\nFurthermore, due to the permissionless nature of the execution step, the [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) method does not enforce any constraints on the `msg.sender`; therefore, allows anyone to invoke it.\n\n**Attack path:**\n\nAn adversary can monitor the `ASDRouter` contract for [whitelisted](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L79) incoming USDC-like OFTs and immediately use those on their own (redeem `asD`) by crafting & invoking a call to [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) before an executor does. As a consequence, user funds are directly stolen.\n\nSimilarly, if [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) fails for any reason, an adversary can re-try before the user to use the OFTs.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nThe dual transaction nature of the current composed message process is confirmed by the LayerZero [documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart#optional-\\_composedmsg):\n\n> If the message is composed, the contract retrieves and re-encodes the additional composed message information, then delivers the message to the endpoint, which will execute the additional logic as a separate transaction.\n\nMoreover, crafting a successful call to [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) once OFTs are deposited is demonstrated by the existing test case [\"lzCompose: successful deposit and send on canto\"](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/test/ASDRouter.js#L276-L297).\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nImmediate, but not a satisfying fix: Restrict the [lzCompose(...)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto/blob/1516028017a34ccfb4b0b19f5c5f17f5fa4cad42/contracts/asd/asdRouter.sol#L52-L111) method to trusted/whitelisted executors.\n\nAlternative: Design change by directly implementing [`_lzReceive`(...)](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#implementing-\\_lzreceive) (building an `OApp`) such that a composed message is not needed anymore.\n\n### Assessed type\n\nInvalid Validation\n\n**[3docSec (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/5#issuecomment-2036426301):**\n > Looks legitimate: `lzCompose` is permissionless and can be front-run because [LayerZero calls it in a separate transaction after funds are delivered](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/1fde89479fdc68b1a54cda7f19efa84483fcacc4/oapp/contracts/oft/OFTCore.sol#L238C1-L253C10).\n\n**[dsudit01 (Canto) confirmed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-canto-findings/issues/5#issuecomment-2040524459):**\n > PR [here](https://github.com/Plex-Engineer/ASD-V2/pull/4).\n\n***\n\n",

This version of asD implements LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token to allow creators from any LayerZero supported chain to earn extra revenue from all stable coin deposits.\n\n#### Useful background information\n\n- NOTE: https://docs.canto.io/overview/canto-unit-of-account-usdnote\n- Canto Lending Market: https://docs.canto.io/overview/canto-lending-market-clm\n- Compound cTOKEN Documentation: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens\n- Layer Zero: https://docs.layerzero.network/contracts/overview\n- asD ERC20 c4 audit: https://code4rena.com/audits/2023-11-canto-application-specific-dollars-and-bonding-curves-for-1155s\n\n## asD Flow\n\nThe purpose of implementing cross chain functionality with asD is to allow developers from any supported chain to earn Canto Lending Market yield without needing to directly deploy their entire protocol on the Canto application layer. By using Layer Zero v2, we can accomplish this by bridging whitelisted stable coins to mint asD tokens that can then be bridged back to the original application.\n\n![asD Flow](asdFlow.png)\n\n## Contracts\n\n### ASDOFT\n\nThe ASDOFT contract is a direct implementation of the ASD ERC20 token used for [1155Tech](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto) however it also implements LayerZero v2 OFT functionality. This allows for asD tokens minted on Canto as well as easily bridged back to the source application to be used in the protocol.\n\nIn order to ensure a 1:1 peg to $NOTE, only the ASDOFT should be deployed on Canto for minting, and regular OFT implementations should be deployed on all other supported chains.\n\n### ASDRouter\n\nThe ASDRouter contract allows for the minting of asD tokens to be done in a single transaction originating from any supported chain. A stable coin represented as an OFT is sent to the ASDRouter with \"lzCompose\" options passed to tell the Layer Zero executor to call `lzCompose` once it receives the message.\n\n```javascript\n function lzCompose(\n    address _from,\n    bytes32 _guid,\n    bytes calldata _message,\n    address _executor,\n    bytes calldata _extraData) external payable;\n```\n\nA user who wants to obtain asD tokens must send their stable assets to the ASDRouter through Layer Zero. The `_message` must be formatted as bytes with the form of the OFTComposeMessage struct:\n\n```javascript\nstruct OftComposeMessage {\n    uint32 _dstLzEid; // destination endpoint id\n    address _dstReceiver; // receiver on destination\n    address _dstAsdAddress; // asD address on destination\n    address _cantoAsdAddress; // asD on Canto (where to mint asD from)\n    uint256 _minAmountASD; // minimum amount (slippage for swap)\n    address _cantoRefundAddress; // canto refund address\n    uint256 _feeForSend; // fee for bridge to destination chain\n}\n```\n\nThis struct tells the Router which asD tokens to mint and where to send them after they are obtained. The `lzCompose` function on the Router performs the following steps\n\n1. Deposits stable coin for asdUSDC\n2. Swaps asdUSDC in ambient pool for $NOTE\n3. Deposits $NOTE to asD Vault for asD tokens\n4. Sends asD tokens to destination chain and address\n\nAfter lzCompose has been called, the Router should never have any tokens left over (all tokens are refunded or sent). With Layer Zero execution, if the `lzCompose` reverts, the OFT tokens are still received by the Router, but the compose message can be retried. Because of this, the Router protects against reverts by implementing saftey checks and refunds during each step. All refunds will be sent to the user's address on Canto. For any message that contains `msg.value`, the entire amount will also be refunded to the user as Canto.\n\nSaftey checks:\n\n1. Incorrect compose message formatting (OFT refunded)\n2. Not whitelisted stable coin version (OFT refunded)\n3. Unsuccessful swap to $NOTE (usdcOFT refunded)\n4. Unsuccessful deposit into asD vault ($NOTE refunded)\n5. Unsuccessful bridge of asD to destination of insufficient fee (asD refunded)\n\n### ASDUSDC\n\nASDUSDC is a simple wrapper for all of the different representations for the same stable coins that might be bridged through Layer Zero. The purpose of this is to limit the amount of pools needed for swapping tokens to $NOTE. With this wrapper, only one pool is needed and all OFT's representing the same can be wrapped into ASDUSDC and swapped for Note easily. A user can deposit any of the whitelisted usdc versions to mint ASDUSDC as well as withdraw any of those same versions (as long as there is enough locked) by burning their ASDUSDC.\n\n\n## Links\n\n-

This version of asD implements LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token to allow creators from any LayerZero supported chain to earn extra revenue from all stable coin deposits.\n\n#### Useful background information\n\n- NOTE: https://docs.canto.io/overview/canto-unit-of-account-usdnote\n- Canto Lending Market: https://docs.canto.io/overview/canto-lending-market-clm\n- Compound cTOKEN Documentation: https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens\n- Layer Zero: https://docs.layerzero.network/contracts/overview\n- asD ERC20 c4 audit: https://code4rena.com/audits/2023-11-canto-application-specific-dollars-and-bonding-curves-for-1155s\n\n## asD Flow\n\nThe purpose of implementing cross chain functionality with asD is to allow developers from any supported chain to earn Canto Lending Market yield without needing to directly deploy their entire protocol on the Canto application layer. By using Layer Zero v2, we can accomplish this by bridging whitelisted stable coins to mint asD tokens that can then be bridged back to the original application.\n\n![asD Flow](asdFlow.png)\n\n## Contracts\n\n### ASDOFT\n\nThe ASDOFT contract is a direct implementation of the ASD ERC20 token used for [1155Tech](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-11-canto) however it also implements LayerZero v2 OFT functionality. This allows for asD tokens minted on Canto as well as easily bridged back to the source application to be used in the protocol.\n\nIn order to ensure a 1:1 peg to $NOTE, only the ASDOFT should be deployed on Canto for minting, and regular OFT implementations should be deployed on all other supported chains.\n\n### ASDRouter\n\nThe ASDRouter contract allows for the minting of asD tokens to be done in a single transaction originating from any supported chain. A stable coin represented as an OFT is sent to the ASDRouter with \"lzCompose\" options passed to tell the Layer Zero executor to call `lzCompose` once it receives the message.\n\n```javascript\n function lzCompose(\n    address _from,\n    bytes32 _guid,\n    bytes calldata _message,\n    address _executor,\n    bytes calldata _extraData) external payable;\n```\n\nA user who wants to obtain asD tokens must send their stable assets to the ASDRouter through Layer Zero. The `_message` must be formatted as bytes with the form of the OFTComposeMessage struct:\n\n```javascript\nstruct OftComposeMessage {\n    uint32 _dstLzEid; // destination endpoint id\n    address _dstReceiver; // receiver on destination\n    address _dstAsdAddress; // asD address on destination\n    address _cantoAsdAddress; // asD on Canto (where to mint asD from)\n    uint256 _minAmountASD; // minimum amount (slippage for swap)\n    address _cantoRefundAddress; // canto refund address\n    uint256 _feeForSend; // fee for bridge to destination chain\n}\n```\n\nThis struct tells the Router which asD tokens to mint and where to send them after they are obtained. The `lzCompose` function on the Router performs the following steps\n\n1. Deposits stable coin for asdUSDC\n2. Swaps asdUSDC in ambient pool for $NOTE\n3. Deposits $NOTE to asD Vault for asD tokens\n4. Sends asD tokens to destination chain and address\n\nAfter lzCompose has been called, the Router should never have any tokens left over (all tokens are refunded or sent). With Layer Zero execution, if the `lzCompose` reverts, the OFT tokens are still received by the Router, but the compose message can be retried. Because of this, the Router protects against reverts by implementing saftey checks and refunds during each step. All refunds will be sent to the user's address on Canto. For any message that contains `msg.value`, the entire amount will also be refunded to the user as Canto.\n\nSaftey checks:\n\n1. Incorrect compose message formatting (OFT refunded)\n2. Not whitelisted stable coin version (OFT refunded)\n3. Unsuccessful swap to $NOTE (usdcOFT refunded)\n4. Unsuccessful deposit into asD vault ($NOTE refunded)\n5. Unsuccessful bridge of asD to destination of insufficient fee (asD refunded)\n\n### ASDUSDC\n\nASDUSDC is a simple wrapper for all of the different representations for the same stable coins that might be bridged through Layer Zero. The purpose of this is to limit the amount of pools needed for swapping tokens to $NOTE. With this wrapper, only one pool is needed and all OFT's representing the same can be wrapped into ASDUSDC and swapped for Note easily. A user can deposit any of the whitelisted usdc versions to mint ASDUSDC as well as wit"
