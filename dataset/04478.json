  "Title": "cToken Related Issues",
  "Content": "###### cTokens might not be transferable\n\n\nCurrently cTokens can not be transferred if they are required to collateralize a loan, but there are no functions to check if users’ cTokens are locked. This is not standard ERC20 behaviour and could be confusing to users.  \n\nConsidering adding a related function to check if users’ cTokens are transferable.\n\n\n###### ERC20 double spend race condition\n\n\nDue to `CToken`‘s inheritance of ERC20’s `approve` function, it is vulnerable to the ERC20 approve and double spend front running attack. Briefly, an authorized spender could spend both allowances by front running an allowance-changing transaction. Consider implementing OpenZeppelin’s [`decreaseAllowance`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.3.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L133) and [`increaseAllowance`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.3.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L114) functions to help mitigate this.\n\n\n###### ERC20 decimals size\n\n\nThe EIP20 specification [optionally defines a `uint8` `decimals` field](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#decimals). However, the [corresponding field](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/f385d71983ae5c5799faae9b2dfea43e5cf75262/contracts/CToken.sol#L35) in the `CToken` contract is a `uint256`. This is not compliant with the specification and may cause confusion when interacting with wallets and dApps. Consider setting the `decimals` type to `uint8`.\n\n\n###### 0 Address for Mints & Burns\n\n\nAlthough not technically part of the EIP20 specification, it is common practice to use the zero address as the source for all `Transfer` events after minting, and as the destination for `Transfer`s upon burning tokens. The `Transfer` events in functions [`mintFresh`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/f385d71983ae5c5799faae9b2dfea43e5cf75262/contracts/CToken.sol#L766) and [`redeemFresh`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/f385d71983ae5c5799faae9b2dfea43e5cf75262/contracts/CToken.sol#L913) use the address of the `CToken` contract instead. Consider using the zero address instead or informing users and developers of this feature.\n\n\n###### Mixing concerns\n\n\nThe `CToken` contract performs three different categories of functions:  \n\n1. ERC20 operations including transferring tokens, checking balances and setting allowances  \n\n1. Administrative operations such as setting the comptroller, interest rate model and reserve rate  \n\n1. The borrowing, loaning, repaying and liquidating operations as well as their support functions\n\n\nFor simplicity and readability, consider splitting it into multiple contracts with distinct roles.\n\n\n",
