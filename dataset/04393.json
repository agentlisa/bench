  "Title": "[L01][Fixed] Not following check-effect-interaction pattern",
  "Content": "In the [`issueOTokens` function of the `OptionsContract` contract](https://github.com/opynfinance/Convexity-Protocol/blob/c34598565cba2bfcf824eb2da63d95c7f5dda4fa/contracts/OptionsContract.sol#L304-L305) a `Repo` owner can `mint` new oTokens and send them to a third party.\n\n\nOnce the check confirms that the new amount of oTokens is safe, it mints them and transfers them to the destinatary.\n\n\nThere is an issue with the order of the operations: First the oTokens are minted, and then the put balance of the `Repo` is updated .\n\n\nAlthough a reentrancy cannot happen in this case, to preserve a [safer *check-effect-interaction* pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.11/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern), consider inverting the order of those operations.\n\n\n**Update**: *Fixed in the follow-up commit [`3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e`](https://github.com/opynfinance/Convexity-Protocol/commit/3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e) where [`_mint` function](https://github.com/opynfinance/Convexity-Protocol/blob/3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e/contracts/OptionsContract.sol#L466) is only called after `vault.oTokensIssued` has been updated.*\n\n\n",
