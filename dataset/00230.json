  "Title": "Unnecessary Payable Function Definition",
  "Content": "The `proposeL2Output` [function](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/blob/e29d360904db5e5ec81888885f7b7250f8255895/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L179) of the `L2OutputOracle` contract is defined as `payable` but it does not handle any `msg.value`. While the function is restricted to be called exclusively by the `PROPOSER`, if any `msg.value` is passed, funds can get stuck in the contract as there is no way to pull them out.\n\n\nConsider whether the `proposeL2Output` has to be `payable` and document the reason. Alternatively, consider removing the `payable` attribute.\n\n\n***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #138](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/pull/138) at commit [af0d029](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/tree/af0d029ae5222e39b3aae4f9d07569708c2cbdf9).*\n\n\n",
