  "Content": "The `StakeLocked` event specifies a [`withdrawTime` parameter](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/6dea6d8752f64914dd95d932f673ba0f9ff8e144/contracts/interfaces/IStakeManager.sol#L26), but the argument passed in is the [new unstake delay](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/6dea6d8752f64914dd95d932f673ba0f9ff8e144/contracts/core/StakeManager.sol#L73). Consider renaming the event parameter to match its actual usage.\n\n\n***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #197](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/pull/197) and merged at commit [`545a15c`](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/commit/545a15cfdc793be375c2747ea90900612c00e077).*\n\n\n",
