In other words and more generally the users' votes are worth less than they should be as the percentage is calculated against a total amount that is too big.\n\nIn short, this is how the issue is caused:\n\n1.  The voting power that a user receives is based on the amount they contribute MINUS funding fees\n2.  The amount of voting power by which `totalVotingPower` is increased is based on the total contributions WITHOUT subtracting funding fees\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nLet's first look at the affected code and then at the PoC.\n\nThe `votingPower` that a user receives for making a contribution is calculated in the `ETHCrowdfundBase._processContribution` function.\n\nWe can see that first the funding fee is subtracted and then with the lowered `amount`, the `votingPower` is calculated:\n\n[Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-party/blob/440aafacb0f15d037594cebc85fd471729bcb6d9/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol#L224-L233)\n\n```solidity\n// Subtract fee from contribution amount if applicable.\naddress payable fundingSplitRecipient_ = fundingSplitRecipient;\nuint16 fundingSplitBps_ = fundingSplitBps;\nif (fundingSplitRecipient_ != address(0) && fundingSplitBps_ > 0) {\n    uint96 feeAmount = (amount * fundingSplitBps_) / 1e4;\n    amount -= feeAmount;\n}\n\n\n// Calculate voting power.\nvotingPower = (amount * exchangeRateBps) / 1e4;\n```\n\nEven before that, `totalContributions` has been increased by the full `amount` (funding fees have not been subtracted yet):\n\n[Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-party/blob/440aafacb0f15d037594cebc85fd471729bcb6d9/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol#L204-L222)\n\n```solidity\nuint96 newTotalContributions = totalContributions + amount;\nuint96 maxTotalContributions_ = maxTotalContributions;\nif (newTotalContributions >= maxTotalContributions_) {\n    totalContributions = maxTotalContributions_;\n\n\n    // Finalize the crowdfund.\n    // This occurs before refunding excess contribution to act as a\n    // reentrancy guard.\n    _finalize(maxTotalContributions_);\n\n\n    // Refund excess contribution.\n    uint96 refundAmount = newTotalContributions - maxTotalContributions;\n    if (refundAmount > 0) {\n        amount -= refundAmount;\n        payable(msg.sender).transferEth(refundAmount);\n    }\n} else {\n    totalContributions = newTotalContributions;\n}\n```\n\n(Note that the above code looks more complicated than it is because it accounts for the fact that `maxTotalContributions` might be reached. But this is not important for explaining this issue)\n\nWhen `PartyGovernanceNFT.increaseTotalVotingPower` is called it is with the `newVotingPower` that has been calculated BEFORE funding fees are subtracted:\n\n[Link](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-party/blob/440aafacb0f15d037594cebc85fd471729bcb6d9/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol#L278-L288)\n\n```solidity\nuint96 newVotingPower = (totalContributions_ * exchangeRateBps) / 1e4;\nparty.increaseTotalVotingPower(newVotingPower);\n\n\n// Transfer fee to recipient if applicable.\naddress payable fundingSplitRecipient_ = fundingSplitRecipient;\nuint16 fundingSplitBps_ = fundingSplitBps;\nif (fundingSplitRecipient_ != address(0) && fundingSplitBps_ > 0) {\n    uint96 feeAmount = (totalContributions_ * fundingSplitBps_) / 1e4;\n    totalContributions_ -= feeAmount;\n    fundingSplitRecipient_.transferEth(feeAmount);\n}\n```\n\nTherefore `totalVotingPower` is increased more than the sum of the voting power that the users have received.\n\nLet's look at the PoC:\n\n```javascript\nfunction test_totalVotingPower_increased_too_much() public {\n        ReraiseETHCrowdfund crowdfund = _createCrowdfund({\n            initialContribution: 0,\n            initialContributor: payable(address(0)),\n            initialDelegate: address(0),\n            minContributions: 0,\n            maxContributions: type(uint96).max,\n            disableContributingForExistingCard: false,\n            minTotalContributions: 2 ether,\n            maxTotalContributions: 5 ether,\n            duration: 7 days,\n            fundingSplitBps: 1000,\n            fundingSplitRecipient: payable(address(1))\n        });\n\n        address member1 = _randomAddress();\n        address member2 = _randomAddress();\n        vm.deal(member1, 1 ether);\n        vm.deal(member2, 1 ether);\n\n        // Contribute, should be allowed to update delegate\n        vm.startPrank(member1);\n        crowdfund.contribute{ value: 1 ether }(member1, \"\");\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        vm.startPrank(member2);\n        crowdfund.contribute{ value: 1 ether }(member2, \"\");\n        vm.stopPrank();\n\n        skip(7 days);\n        console.log(party.getGovernanceValues().totalVotingPower);\n        crowdfund.finalize();\n        console.log(party.getGovernanceValues().totalVotingPower);\n\n        console.log(crowdfund.pendingVotingPower(member1));\n        console.log(crowdfund.pendingVotingPower(member2));\n    }\n```\n\nSee that `totalVotingPower` is increased from `0` to `2e18`.\n\nThe voting power of both users is `0.9e18` (10% fee).\n\nThereby both users together receive a voting power of `1.8e18` which is only 90% of `2e18`.\n\nTherefore it is impossible to reach an unanimous vote.\n\n### Tools Used\n\nVSCode, Foundry\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThe fix is easy:<br>\nWe must consider the funding fee when increasing the `totalVotingPower`.\n\nFix:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol b/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol\nindex 4392655..3c11160 100644\n--- a/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol\n+++ b/contracts/crowdfund/ETHCrowdfundBase.sol\n@@ -274,10 +274,6 @@ contract ETHCrowdfundBase is Implementation {\n         // Finalize the crowdfund.\n         delete expiry;\n \n-        // Update the party's total voting power.\n-        uint96 newVotingPower = (totalContributions_ * exchangeRateBps) / 1e4;\n-        party.increaseTotalVotingPower(newVotingPower);\n-\n         // Transfer fee to recipient if applicable.\n         address payable fundingSplitRecipient_ = fundingSplitRecipient;\n         uint16 fundingSplitBps_ = fundingSplitBps;\n@@ -287,6 +283,10 @@ contract ETHCrowdfundBase is Implementation {\n             fundingSplitRecipient_.transferEth(feeAmount);\n         }\n \n+        // Update the party's total voting power.\n+        uint96 newVotingPower = (totalContributions_ * exchangeRateBps) / 1e4;\n+        party.increaseTotalVotingPower(newVotingPower);\n+        \n         // Transfer ETH to the party.\n         payable(address(party)).transferEth(totalContributions_);\n     }\n```\n\n**[0xean (judge) increased severity to High and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-party-findings/issues/11#issuecomment-1509823808):**\n > I am upgrading severity here to match [`#27`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-party-findings/issues/27) and will look forward to sponsor comments.\n> \n> I think this exposes a way in which there are parameter sets that leads to a loss of funds by not allowing any proposal to be executed. \n\n**[0xble (Party) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-party-findings/issues/11#issuecomment-1512119443)**\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
