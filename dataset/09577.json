We think it is a reasonable expectation that users calling this should know what they are doing. We feel this is OK especially because other major protocols like Uniswap do this ([Uniswap/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L156](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L156)).\n\n**[gzeon (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backed-findings/issues/83#issuecomment-1100090670):**\n > I believe Med Risk is a fair assessment given the mixed/inconsistent usage of `safeTransferFrom` and `transferFrom` in the contract.\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
