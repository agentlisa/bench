Assume that Alice is the proposer.\n2.  Alice calls `Migration.propose` to propose a set of modules and plugins to migrate a vault to\n3.  Other contributors could join a migration proposal by contributing ether and fractional tokens by calling `Migration.join`.\n4.  Alice calls `Migration.commit` to kick off the buyout process for a migration after the proposal period (7 days)\n5.  If the buyout is successful, Alice calls the `Migration.settleVault` to settle a migration. Within this function,  a new vault with new set permissions and plugins will be deployed.\n6.  Alice calls the `Migration.settleFractions` to mint the fractional tokens for a new vault.\n7.  Contributors who earlier joined the migration proposal could call the `Migration.migrateFractions` to migrate their fractional tokens from the old vault to the new vault.\n8.  Finally, Alice will call `Migration.migrateVaultERC20`, `Migration.migrateVaultERC721`, and/or `Migration.migrateVaultERC1155` to transfer the ERC20, ERC721 (NFT), and/or ERC1155 tokens from the old vault to the new vault.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\nIt was observed that after a successful vault migration, an attacker could [`Migration.migrateVaultERC20`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L334), [`Migration.migrateVaultERC721`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L358), and/or [`Migration.migrateVaultERC1155`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L383) with an invalid `_proposalId` parameter, causing the assets within the vault to be burned.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n> The PoC for `Migration.migrateVaultERC20`, `Migration.migrateVaultERC721`, and/or `Migration.migrateVaultERC1155` is the same. Thus, only the PoC for `Migration.migrateVaultERC721` is shown below, and the PoC for `migrateVaultERC20` and `migrateVaultERC1155` are omitted for brevity.\n\nAssume that the following:\n\n*   `vault A` holds only one (1) APE ERC721 NFT\n\n*   Alice proposes to migrate ` vault A  ` to a new vault, and the buyout is successful.\n\n*   Alice proceeds to call `Migration.settleVault` to settle a migration, followed by `Migration.settleFractions` to mint the fractional tokens for a new vault.\n\n*   An attacker calls `Migration.migrateVaultERC721(vault A, invalid_proposal_id, ape_nft_address, ape_nft_tokenId, erc721TransferProof)` with an invalid proposal ID (proposal ID that does not exist).\n    *   Within the `Migration.migrateVaultERC721` function, the `newVault = migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].newVault` will evaluate to zero. This is because the `_proposalId` is a non-existent index in the `migrationInfo` array, so it will point to an address space that has not been initialised yet. Thus, the value `zero` will be returned, and `newVault` will be set to `address(0)`.\n\n*   Next, the `Migration.migrateVaultERC721` function will attempt to transfer the ERC721 NFT from the old vault (`_vault`) to the new vault (`newVault`) by calling `IBuyout(buyout).withdrawERC721`. Since `newVault` is set to `address(0)`, this will cause the ERC721 NFT to be sent to `address(0)`, which effectively burns the NFT.\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Migration.sol#L358>\n\n```solidity\n/// @notice Migrates an ERC-721 token to the new vault after a successful migration\n/// @param _vault Address of the vault\n/// @param _proposalId ID of the proposal\n/// @param _token Address of the ERC-721 token\n/// @param _tokenId ID of the token\n/// @param _erc721TransferProof Merkle proof for transferring an ERC-721 token\nfunction migrateVaultERC721(\n    address _vault,\n    uint256 _proposalId,\n    address _token,\n    uint256 _tokenId,\n    bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof\n) external {\n    address newVault = migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].newVault;\n    // Withdraws an ERC-721 token from the old vault and transfers to the new vault\n    IBuyout(buyout).withdrawERC721(\n        _vault,\n        _token,\n        newVault,\n        _tokenId,\n        _erc721TransferProof\n    );\n}\n```\n\n#### Additional Note #1 - About `Buyout.withdrawERC721`\n\nWhen a user proposes a migration, the user will kick off the buyout process after the proposal period. The `Migration` module will initiate the buyout on behalf of the user. Thus, the proposer of this buyout, in this case, would be the `Migration` module. Whenever `Buyout.withdrawERC721` function is called, it will verify that `msg.sender` is equal to the `proposer` to ensure that only the proposer who is the auction winner can migrate the assets from old vault to new vault.\n\nIn this example, the attacker has access to `Migration.migrateVaultERC20`, `Migration.migrateVaultERC721`, and/or `Migration.migrateVaultERC1155` functions that effectively instruct the `Migration` module to perform the withdrawal. In this case, it will pass the `if (msg.sender != proposer) revert NotWinner();` validation within the `Buyout.withdrawERC721` because the `msg.sender` is the `Migration` contract who initiates the buyout at the start.\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional/blob/8f2697ae727c60c93ea47276f8fa128369abfe51/src/modules/Buyout.sol#L343>\n\n```solidity\nfunction IBuyout(buyout).withdrawERC721(\n    address _vault,\n    address _token,\n    address _to,\n    uint256 _tokenId,\n    bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof\n) external {\n    // Reverts if address is not a registered vault\n    (, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(_vault);\n    if (id == 0) revert NotVault(_vault);\n    // Reverts if auction state is not successful\n    (, address proposer, State current, , , ) = this.buyoutInfo(_vault);\n    State required = State.SUCCESS;\n    if (current != required) revert InvalidState(required, current);\n    // Reverts if caller is not the auction winner\n    if (msg.sender != proposer) revert NotWinner();\n\n    // Initializes vault transaction\n    bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(\n        ITransfer.ERC721TransferFrom,\n        (_token, _vault, _to, _tokenId)\n    );\n    // Executes transfer of ERC721 token to caller\n    ..SNIP..\n}\n```\n\n#### Additional Note #2 - Can we send NFT to address(0)?\n\nYes, it is possible to send NFT to `address(0)`.\n\nIf the ERC721 NFT contract uses [Openzeppelin's ERC721 contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol) or [Solmate's ERC721 contract](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/03e425421b24c4f75e4a3209b019b367847b7708/src/tokens/ERC721.sol#L89), then the NFT cannot be sent to `address(0)` because the contracts have implemented validation check to ensure that the `to` address is not `address(0)`.\n\nHowever, not all the ERC721 NFT contracts use Openzeppelin or Solmate ERC721 implementation. Therefore, there will be a large number of custom implementations that allow NFT to be transferred to `address(0)`.\n\nThe same theory applies to ERC20 and ERC1155 implementations.\n\n### Impact\n\nLoss of assets for the users as the assets that they own can be burned by an attacker after a successful migration.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nIt is recommended to implement additional validation to ensure that the `_proposalId` submitted is valid.\n\nConsider checking if `newVault` points to a valid vault address before transferring the assets from old vault to new vault.\n\n```diff\nfunction migrateVaultERC721(\n    address _vault,\n    uint256 _proposalId,\n    address _token,\n    uint256 _tokenId,\n    bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof\n) external {\n    address newVault = migrationInfo[_vault][_proposalId].newVault;\n+    if (newVault == address(0)) reverts VaultDoesNotExistOrInvalid;\n    \n    // Withdraws an ERC-721 token from the old vault and transfers to the new vault\n    IBuyout(buyout).withdrawERC721(\n        _vault,\n        _token,\n        newVault,\n        _tokenId,\n        _erc721TransferProof\n    );\n}\n```\n\nIn the above implementation, if anyone attempts to submit an invalid `_proposalId`, the `newVault` will be set to address(0). The newly implemented validation will detect the abnormal behavior and revert the transaction.\n\nFor defense-in-depth, perform additional validation to ensure that the `_to` address is not `address(0)` within the `Buyout.withdrawERC721` function.\n\n```diff\nfunction withdrawERC721(\n    address _vault,\n    address _token,\n    address _to,\n    uint256 _tokenId,\n    bytes32[] calldata _erc721TransferProof\n) external {\n    // Reverts if address is not a registered vault\n    (, uint256 id) = IVaultRegistry(registry).vaultToToken(_vault);\n    if (id == 0) revert NotVault(_vault);\n+   if (_to == 0) revert ToAddressIsZero(); \n    // Reverts if auction state is not successful\n    (, address proposer, State current, , , ) = this.buyoutInfo(_vault);\n    State required = State.SUCCESS;\n    if (current != required) revert InvalidState(required, current);\n    // Reverts if caller is not the auction winner\n    if (msg.sender != proposer) revert NotWinner();\n\n    // Initializes vault transaction\n    bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(\n        ITransfer.ERC721TransferFrom,\n        (_token, _vault, _to, _tokenId)\n    );\n    // Executes transfer of ERC721 token to caller\n    IVault(payable(_vault)).execute(transfer, data, _erc721TransferProof);\n}\n```\n\nThe same validation checks should be implemented on `migrateVaultERC20`, `migrateVaultERC1155`, `withdrawERC20` and `withdrawERC1155`\n\n**[stevennevins (Fractional) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional-findings/issues/649)**\n\n**[HardlyDifficult (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional-findings/issues/459#issuecomment-1203328808):**\n > `migrateVaultERC20` could transfer assets to address(0). ERC721 and 1155 standards require revert when to is address(0), but this is not required by the ERC20 standard. This could be triggered by calling migrate with an invalid `proposalId`.
