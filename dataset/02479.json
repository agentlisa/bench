  "Content": "# Issue M-8: Optimism Portal can run out of gas due to incorrect overhead estimation \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism-judging/issues/138 \n\n## Found by \nGalloDaSballo\n\n## Summary\n\nIn contrast to `CrossDomainMessenger` which has a 5k gas buffer, the Optimism Portal doesn't, meaning all its relayed calls will have 5k+ less gas than intended.\n\nThis forces integrations (e.g. Bridges) to spend more gas by default, because of a logic flaw.\n\nFor this reason am filing the finding as Medium Severity:\n- Programming Mistake (Math is incorrect)\n- Call forwards less gas than intended and can revert because of it\n\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\n`CrossDomainMessenger` will compute the gas-required, adding a 5k gas buffer\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L318-L324\n\nIt will then pass the remainder of the gas, minus the buffer as it's assumed to have been spent for the SSTORE\n\nOptimism Portal on the other hand will not do that\n\n## Impact\n\nBy only checking that\n```solidity\ngasleft() >= _tx.gasLimit + FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER /// @audit At least gasLimit + buffer\n```\n\nThe check will ensure that before the SSTORE + Call the buffer is available\n\nHowever, the following SSTORE will consider 5k+ (5k for SSTORE, hundreds of gas for overhead)\n\nThis will leave the SafeCall with less gas than intended\n```solidity\n            gasleft() - FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER, /// @audit gasLeft will be < tx.gasLimit because we've subtracted the same constant\n```\n\n`SafeCall` will have less gas than intended, meaning that every integrator that estimates their TXs accurately will have their tx revert.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L310-L328\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nRecompute the buffer to add the extra 5k + the overhead of the SSTORE (in the few hundreds of gas)\n\nTo ensure the call has enough gas, you may also consider swapping positions between the SSTORE and the require\n\n```solidity\n        // Set the l2Sender so contracts know who triggered this withdrawal on L2.\n        l2Sender = _tx.sender;\n\n        require(\n            gasleft() >= _tx.gasLimit + FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,\n            \"OptimismPortal: insufficient gas to finalize withdrawal\"\n        );\n\n        // Trigger the call to the target contract. We use SafeCall because we don't\n        // care about the returndata and we don't want target contracts to be able to force this\n        // call to run out of gas via a returndata bomb.\n        bool success = SafeCall.call(\n            _tx.target,\n            gasleft() - FINALIZE_GAS_BUFFER,\n            _tx.value,\n            _tx.data\n        );\n```\n\n## Discussion\n\n**rcstanciu**\n\nComment from Optimism\n\n---\n\nSeverity: medium\n\n\nReason: see 109\n\n\n\n**zobront**\n\nEscalate for 250 USDC\n\nThis report should not be a duplicate of #109. \n\nFor an issue to be judged as High, it requires the Watson to (a) understand the exploit and (b) provide a report with an adequate burden of proof for a High Severity Finding. This report does neither.\n\nWhile the same underlying root cause is identified as #109, the Watson does not see the possibility that this could be used to brick legitimate withdrawals. Instead, it's seen merely as something that might happen accidentally. As a result, the Watson files the report as a Medium Severity, which is appropriate for what he found. \n\nAs a example, if you look at #109, you'll see:\n- an explicit exploit vector that justified High Severity\n- calculations for exactly how much extra gas is needed\n- a full, runnable POC\n- submitted as a high, accepted as a high\n\nFor this issue, we see:\n- thinks it can only happen by accident\n- no detailed explanation or gas calculation\n- no POC\n- submitted as only a medium\n- optimism's comment is that it was accepted as just a medium\n\nI understand that Optimism's team simply lumped them together because they address the same issue. But based on Sherlock's rules, issues of different severity should not be dup'd together. For that reason, we believe this should be dedup'd from #109 and live as its own issue.\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n > Escalate for 250 USDC\n> \n> This report should not be a duplicate of #109. \n> \n> For an issue to be judged as High, it requires the Watson to (a) understand the exploit and (b) provide a report with an adequate burden of proof for a High Severity Finding.
