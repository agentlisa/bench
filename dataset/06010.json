  "Content": "### Summary\n\nInconsistent names between the contract file name and the contract name.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\n\nAs per the official Solidity documentation, it is recommended to have the same name for the file and the contract contained in it: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/style-guide.html#contract-and-library-names\n\n`Contract and library names should also match their filenames.`\n\n### Impact\n\nThe current name structure can be misleading.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nAffected contract:\n- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-goodentry/blob/4b785d455fff04629d8675f21ef1d1632749b252/interfaces/IAaveLendingPoolV2.sol#L8\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nRename the interface or change the file name.\n\n---\n\n",
