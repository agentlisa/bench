  "Content": "_Submitted by sseefried, also found by shenwilly_\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/2d7cd1f6780a9bcc8387dea8fecfbd758462c152/contracts/VeTokenMinter.sol#L36-L38>\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/2d7cd1f6780a9bcc8387dea8fecfbd758462c152/contracts/VeTokenMinter.sol#L41-L4>\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/2d7cd1f6780a9bcc8387dea8fecfbd758462c152/contracts/Booster.sol#L598-L614>\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `totalWeight` state variable of the `VeTokenMinter` contract is used to work out the amount of `veAsset` earned when the `Booster.rewardClaimed` function is called.\n\nHowever, while `totalWeight` is modified inside the `VeTokenMinter` contract when function `updateveAssetWeight` is called, the `totalWeight` is not similarly reduced when function `removeOperator` is called.\n\nThe impact is that remaining operators do not receive a fair share of the total rewards and a portion of the rewards are not given out at all.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n*   Operator 1 is added with weight 9\n*   Operator 2 is added with weight 1\n\nThe `totalWeight` is now 10.\n\nThis means that Operator 1 receives 90% of the amount while Operator 2 receives 10%.\n\nIf we then call `removeOperator` on Operator 1 then 90% of the reward is no longer minted and distributed. This is unfair to the remaining operators.\n\nThe can be seen on lines [607 - 608](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken/blob/2d7cd1f6780a9bcc8387dea8fecfbd758462c152/contracts/Booster.sol#L607-L608) of the `Booster` contract. Function `rewardClaimed` will never be called for (removed) Operator 1. But for Operator 2 they will still receive 10% of the rewards even though Operator 1 is no longer registered in the system.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nThe `totalWeight` should be reduced so that the remaining operators receive a fair share of the total rewards.\n\nUsing just method calls from `VeTokenMinter` one could rectify this situation by\n\n*   adding the removed operator with `addOperator`\n*   setting the weight to `0` using `updateveAssetWeight`. This will have the effect of reducing the `totalWeight` by the right amount.\n*   removing the operator again using `removeOperator`\n\nHowever, the `removeOperator` function should just be rewritten to be as follows:\n\n```\nfunction removeOperator(address _operator) public onlyOwner {\n    totalWeight -= veAssetWeights[_operator];\n    veAssetWeights[_operator] = 0;\n    operators.remove(_operator);\n}\n```\n\nYou might also want to modify `addOperator` so that a weight can be provided as an extra argument. This saves having to call `addOperator` and then `updateveAssetWeight` which could save on gas.\n\n**[solvetony (veToken Finance) disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken-findings/issues/120#issuecomment-1156643912):**\n > Confirmed. But this should be a middle risk. \n\n**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-vetoken-findings/issues/120#issuecomment-1193397795):**\n > The warden has shown how, due to a privileged call, removing an operator, the weight used to distribute rewards will not be updated fairly. \n> This will cause an improper distribution of rewards.\n> \n> Because the finding is limited to Loss of Yield, due to Admin Configuration, I believe Medium Severity to be more appropriate.\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
