  "Content": "\n[ERC721.sol#L395-L417](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/ce0068c21ecd97c6ec8fb0db08570f4b43029dde/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L395-L417)<br>\n\nWhile `VoteEscrowCore.safeTransferFrom` does try to call `onERC721Received` on the receiver it does not check the for the required \"magic bytes\" which is `IERC721.onERC721received.selector` in this case. See [OpenZeppelin docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-) for more information.\n\nIt's quite possible that a call to `onERC721Received` could succeed because the contract had a `fallback` function implemented, but the contract is not ERC721 compliant.\n\nThe impact is that NFT tokens may be sent to non-compliant contracts and lost.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n[Lines 604 - 605](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom/blob/e5efa8f9d6dda92a90b8b2c4902320acf0c26816/contracts/vote-escrow/VoteEscrowCore.sol#L604-L605) are:\n\n```solidity\ntry IERC721Receiver(_to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, _from, _tokenId, _data) returns (bytes4) {} catch (\n    bytes memory reason\n```\n\nbut they should be:\n\n```solidity\ntry IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received(_msgSender(), from, tokenId, data) returns (bytes4 retval) {\n    return retval == IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;\n} catch (bytes memory reason)\n```\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nImplement `safeTransferReturn` so that it checks the required magic bytes: `IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector`.\n\n**[zeroexdead (Golom) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom-findings/issues/577)**\n\n**[zeroexdead (Golom) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom-findings/issues/577#issuecomment-1236183431):**\n > Fixed.<br>\n> Ref: https://github.com/golom-protocol/contracts/commit/19ba6e83892e24b859f081525c7e0f751f5e7ebb\n\n**[0xsaruman (Golom) resolved, but disagreed with severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom-findings/issues/577)**\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
