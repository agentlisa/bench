  "Title": "[L12] Mixed testing and production code",
  "Content": "Many contracts, like [`FeePayer`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/1631ef7ad29aaeba756ef3b9a01c667e1343df85/packages/core/contracts/financial-templates/common/FeePayer.sol#L23), inherit from the [`Testable` contract](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/1631ef7ad29aaeba756ef3b9a01c667e1343df85/packages/core/contracts/common/implementation/Testable.sol#L9) in order to manipulate time during tests. Mixing testing and production code is very risky because mistakes in the testing code could put the production code at risk. It also pollutes the production code making it harder to read.\n\n\nConsider renaming the `Testable` contract to something like `TimeProvider`. Consider further isolating the testing code by using two different versions of this contract, instead of a single contract that can switch between different modes. The test version should be stored in the [`test` directory](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/tree/1631ef7ad29aaeba756ef3b9a01c667e1343df85/packages/core/test) and the build environment should select between the two contracts.\n\n\n**Update**: *Not changed. UMA’s statement for the issue:*\n\n\n\n> \n>  We have decided not to address this issue because we view this suggestion as one that would shift complexity from the contracts to the build/deployment infrastructure. We completely agree that having test infrastructure in production contracts is risky, but we view the simplicity of the Testable contracts as a feature. The Testable contract has been previously audited and battle-tested, so we see modifying it as riskier than leaving it in place.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n",
