  "Title": "[M-04] Users cannot receive rewards from `ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager` if their liquidity is too large",
  "Content": "_Submitted by broccoli_\n\n#### Impact\nThere could be an integer underflow error when the reward of an incentive is claimed, forcing users to wait for a sufficient period or reduce their liquidity to claim the rewards.\n\n#### Proof of Concept\nThe unclaimed reward that a user could claim is proportional to the `secondsInside`, which is, in fact, proportional to the position's liquidity. It is possible that the liquidity is too large and causes `secondsInside` to be larger than `secondsUnclaimed`. As a result, the rewards that the user wants to claim exceed the `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed` and causes an integer underflow error, which prevents him from getting the rewards.\n\nReferenced code:\n- [ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L94-L95](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/blob/c405f3402a1ed336244053f8186742d2da5975e9/contracts/pool/concentrated/ConcentratedLiquidityPoolManager.sol#L94-L95)\n\n#### Recommended Mitigation Steps\nCheck whether the `rewards` exceeds the `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed`. If so, then send only `incentive.rewardsUnclaimed` amount of rewards to the user.\n\n**[sarangparikh22 (Sushi) acknowledged](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-09-sushitrident-2-findings/issues/88#issuecomment-942705593):**\n > The problem seems very unlikely to happen, would be great to see a POC.\n\n",
