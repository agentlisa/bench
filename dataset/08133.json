  "Title": "[M-25] Moving average precision is lost",
  "Content": "_Submitted by hyh, also found by CertoraInc, d3e4, and rbserver_\n\nNow the precision is lost in moving average calculations as the difference is calculated separately and added each time, while it typically can be small enough to lose precision in the division involved.\n\nFor example, `10000` moves of `990` size, `numObservations = 1000`. This will yield `0` on each update, while must yield `9900` increase in the moving average.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nMoving average is calculated with the addition of the difference:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L134-L139>\n\n```solidity\n        // Calculate new moving average\n        if (currentPrice > earliestPrice) {\n            _movingAverage += (currentPrice - earliestPrice) / numObs;\n        } else {\n            _movingAverage -= (earliestPrice - currentPrice) / numObs;\n        }\n```\n\n`/ numObs` can lose precision as `currentPrice - earliestPrice` is usually small.\n\nIt is returned on request as is:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L189-L193>\n\n```solidity\n    /// @notice Get the moving average of OHM in the Reserve asset over the defined window (see movingAverageDuration and observationFrequency).\n    function getMovingAverage() external view returns (uint256) {\n        if (!initialized) revert Price_NotInitialized();\n        return _movingAverage;\n    }\n```\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider storing the cumulative `sum`, while returning `sum / numObs` on request:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/2a0b515012b4a40076f6eac487f7816aafb8724a/src/modules/PRICE.sol#L189-L193>\n\n```solidity\n    /// @notice Get the moving average of OHM in the Reserve asset over the defined window (see movingAverageDuration and observationFrequency).\n    function getMovingAverage() external view returns (uint256) {\n        if (!initialized) revert Price_NotInitialized();\n-       return _movingAverage;\n+       return _movingAverage / numObservations;\n    }\n```\n\n**[Oighty (Olympus) disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/483#issuecomment-1238433469):**\n > Keeping track of the observations as a sum and then dividing is a good suggestion. The price values have 18 decimals and the max discrepancy introduced is very small (10**-15) with expected parameter ranges. The potential risk to the protocol seems low though.\n\n**[hyh (warden) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/483#issuecomment-1240994248):**\n > Please notice that discrepancy here is unbounded, i.e. the logic itself does not have any max discrepancy, the divergence between fact and recorded value can pile up over time without a limit.\n> \n> If you do imply that markets should behave in some way that minuses be matched with pluses, then I must say that they really shouldn't.\n\n**[Oighty (Olympus) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/483)**\n\n**[0xean (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/483#issuecomment-1249930031):**\n > Debating between QA and Medium on this one.
