  "Title": "Misuse of FinalizableCrowdsale",
  "Content": "As [documented](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.3.0/contracts/crowdsale/FinalizableCrowdsale.sol#L33-L37), to use `FinalizableCrowdsale` you must inherit from it and define a custom `finalization` function. Instead, in `CATCrowdsale` it was `finalize` that was [redefined](https://github.com/bitclave/crowdsale/blob/057357fecbcc00c9a6cf96831d71d94fb7a13f03/contracts/CATCrowdsale.sol#L102). Although it is not causing any problems in the code as is, the misuse of the library damages reusability. Rename `finalize` to `finalization`, including the `super.finalize()` line.\n\n\n***Update:** This was fixed in the latest version.*\n\n\n",
