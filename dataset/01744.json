  "Content": "# Issue M-3: Loss of user funds  - unchecked Return of ERC20 Transfer \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index-judging/issues/169 \n\n## Found by \n0x007, Bauchibred, bitsurfer, shogoki\n## Summary\n\nSilently failing transfers can result in a partial or total loss of the users investment.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\n\nSome ERC20 Tokens do not revert on failure of the transfer function, but return a bool value instead. Some do not return any value. Therefore it is required to check if a value was returned, and if true, which value it is. This is not done on some places in these contracts.\n\nThe `DebtIssuanceModulev2`, which is required to issue or redeem tokens whenever there is a LeverageModule involved uses the `invokeTransfer` function of the `Invoke` library to transfer ERC20 Tokens from the `SetToken` to the user.\n\n`invokeTransfer` is encoding the Calldata for the regular `transfer` function of ERC20 tokens and  passes it together with the target (ERC20 token address) the SetTokens generic `invoke` function, whichin turn uses `functionCallWithValue` from the Openzeppelin Address Library. This method is bubbling up a possible revert of the call and returning the raw data.\n\nThe generic `invoke` is returning this raw data, however in `invokeTransfer` the return value of `invoke` is ignored and not used. \nAs some ERC20 Tokens do not revert on a failed transfer, but instead return a `false` bool value, the stated behaviour can lead to silently failing transfers.\n\nThis is inside the `DebtIssuanceModulev2` used to:\n\n1. Transfer The \"debt\" (borrowed) Tokens to the user at Issuance\n2. Transfer back the main component Tokens (e.g. aTokens) to the user at Redemption\n\nIf such a Transfer silently fails, the funds will remain inside the setToken contract and the user has no chance to recover them.\n\nIn the issuance event the user receives the SetTokens but not the borrowed Tokens, which he has to repay when he wants to redeem the tokens. (Results in Loss of the \"Debt\")\n\nIn the redemption event the user repays his debt & bruns his Set Tokens, but never receives his original Tokens back. (Total Loss of investment)\n\n## Impact\n\nPossible Loss of all/part of the Investment for the User\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nUsage of invokeTransfer in`DebtIssuanceModulev2`:\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/DebtIssuanceModuleV2.sol#L283\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/DebtIssuanceModuleV2.sol#L315\n\n`invokeTransfer` function ignores return value of `invoke`:\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/lib/Invoke.sol#L66-L78\n\n`invoke` uses `functionCallwithValue` and returns the raw return Data (which is ignored in this case):\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index/blob/main/index-protocol/contracts/protocol/SetToken.sol#L197-L212\n \n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nCheck for the existence and value of the returned data of the Transfer call. If there is a return value, it has to be true. This could be achieved by using Openzeppelins SafeERC20 library´s `safeTransfer`.  \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**Shogoki**\n\nEscalate for 10USDC \nThis should be considered a valid finding. \nit backs up the existing escalation on #236\n\nThere exists a risk of loosing funds due to missing checks on the transfer calls, as described in the report.\n\n\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n > Escalate for 10USDC \n> This should be considered a valid finding. \n> it backs up the existing escalation on #236\n> \n> There exists a risk of loosing funds due to missing checks on the transfer calls, as described in the report.\n> \n> \n\nYou've created a valid escalation for 10 USDC!\n\nTo remove the escalation from consideration: Delete your comment.\n\nYou may delete or edit your escalation comment anytime before the 48-hour escalation window closes. After that, the escalation becomes final.\n\n**0xffff11**\n\nThis should definitely be a duplicate of the [issue that states that the protocol does not work with tokens like USDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index-judging/issues/268). This is just a superset of that issue that has the same fix. \n\n**Shogoki**\n\n> This should definitely be a duplicate of the [issue that states that the protocol does not work with tokens like USDT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index-judging/issues/268). This is just a superset of that issue that has the same fix.\n\nNo it should not. It should be a valid issue together with duplicates like:\n #155, #236 and #280 \n \nThis issue is not about USDT. It is about Tokens that do not revert on failure, which can lead to a silently failed transfer.\n \n\n**hrishibhat**\n\nResult:\nMedium\nHas duplicates \nConsidering this and its duplicates a separate issue as its core issue is different from #314 \n\n**sherlock-admin2**\n\nEscalations have been resolved successfully!\n\nEscalation status:\n- [Shogoki](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-Index-judging/issues/169/#issuecomment-1610407489): accepted\n\n",

The manager can define arbitrary issuance logic\n * in the manager hook, as well as specify issue and redeem fees.\n *\n * NOTE:\n * DebtIssuanceModule contract confirms increase/decrease in balance of component held by the SetToken after every transfer in/out\n * for each component during issuance/redemption. This contract replaces those strict checks with slightly looser checks which\n * ensure that the SetToken remains collateralized after every transfer in/out for each component during issuance/redemption.\n * This module should be used to issue/redeem SetToken whose one or more components return a balance value with +/-1 wei error.\n * For example, this module can be used to issue/redeem SetTokens which has one or more aTokens as its components.\n * The new checks do NOT apply to any transfers that are part of an external position. A token that has rounding issues may lead to\n * reverts if it is included as an external position unless explicitly allowed in a module hook.\n *\n * The getRequiredComponentIssuanceUnits function on this module assumes that Default token balances will be synced on every issuance\n * and redemption.

Module hooks are added to allow for syncing of positions, and component\n * level hooks are added to ensure positions are replicated correctly. The manager can define arbitrary issuance logic\n * in the manager hook, as well as specify issue and redeem fees.\n *\n * NOTE:\n * DebtIssuanceModule contract confirms increase/decrease in balance of component held by the SetToken after every transfer in/out\n * for each component during issuance/redemption. This contract replaces those strict checks with slightly looser checks which\n * ensure that the SetToken remains collateralized after every transfer in/out for each component during issuance/redemption.\n * This module should be used to issue/redeem SetToken whose one or more components return a balance value with +/-1 wei error.\n * For example, this module can be used to issue/redeem SetTokens which has one or more aTokens as its components.\n * The new checks do NOT apply to any transfers that are part of an external position. A token that has rounding issues may lead to\n * reverts if it is included as an external position unless explicitly allowed in a module hook.\n *\n * The getRequiredComponentIssuanceUnits function on this module assumes that Default token balances will be synced on every issuance\n * and redemption.
