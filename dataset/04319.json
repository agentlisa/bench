  "Title": "[L15] Actions in proposals might fail silently when target is an externally-owned account",
  "Content": "The [`executeProposal` function](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Governor.sol#L120) of the `Governor` contract internally calls the private [`_executeCall` function](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Governor.sol#L166) to execute the external call involved in a proposal’s action. In turn, `_executeCall` [uses the low-level `call` function](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Governor.sol#L175) to pass arbitrary data to the target address. However, the function never validates whether the address being called is actually a contract.\n\n\nThe intended use case of the `Governor` contract is to manage the UMA system contracts so proposals will typically include transactions to those contracts, and will be vetted by the UMA DVM. Nevertheless, any assumptions should be represented by explicit constraints in the code. If the transaction contains data but the target is an externally owned account, the external call will still be considered successful (i.e., `_executeCall` will return `true`) even though no code was executed.\n\n\nConsider validating proposals during registration to ensure that, if any data is included in an action, the target address is indeed a deployed contract.\n\n\n**Update:** *Fixed in [PR#1242](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/1242). Proposals are rejected if they include transactions that would send data to an externally owned account.*\n\n\n",
