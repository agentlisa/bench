  "Title": "[L-09] - DUST value too big for tokens with low decimals",
  "Content": "\nSome tokens with a considerable market cap like [GUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gemini-dollar/), or [EURS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stasis-euro/) have 2 decimals.\n\nThe [`DUST`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty/blob/53516c2cdfdfacb662cdea6417c52f23c94d5b5b/src/pools/PoolUtils.sol#L13) value is fixed at `100`, which can be considerable big as dust, since it is used all over the protocol, with many `require` depending on the amount being bigger than it.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nConsider defining dust values considering proportional to the decimals of the tokens\n\n",
