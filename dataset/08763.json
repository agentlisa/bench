  "Title": "[M-06] Bug in `MatchOneToManyOrders` may cause tokens theft",
  "Content": "_Submitted by PwnedNoMore_\n\nThe `MatchOneToManyOrders` does not check whether a given sell order is malicious, i.e., containing no NFT tokens but still requiring payment.\n\nThis may cause the sellers to maliciously profit.\n\nFor example, we have a `buyOrder` and a set of sell orders `[sellOrder0, sellOrder1, sellOrder2]`. Originally, they match well but with a legal price gas (which is common in the real world), i.e., `MatchOneToManyOrders(buyOrder, [sellOrder0, sellOrder1, sellOrder2])` can be successfully processed.\n\nHowever, If the hacker proposes another `sellOrder3` which sells nothing but requests money/tokens. The `MatchOneToManyOrders(buyOrder, [sellOrder0, sellOrder1, sellOrder2, sellOrder3])` will also succeed and the hacker does not need to send out any NFT token but grabs a considerable gain.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nThere are two possible attack scenarios.\n\n#### The `MATCH_EXECUTOR` is not in a good faith\n\n`MATCH_EXECUTOR` can always gain profit by leveraging this vulnerability. That is, every time the executor proposes a `MatchOneToManyOrders`, it can add one more *EMPTY* order to gain the profit.\n\nIt is one kind of centralization issue. All the processes should happen in a trust-less environment.\n\n#### Hackers can brute force the price gaps by sending out a large amount of *EMPTY* sell orders\n\nNote that creating an order happens off-chain. That means, the hacker can send out a large amount of *EMPTY* orders without paying any gas fee.\n\nOnce the executor picks any of the malicious orders, the hacker can gain the profit without a loss of NFT tokens.\n\nThis vulnerability also affects `matchOrders`.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nFor full details, see [original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity-findings/issues/65).\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nTo mitigate the issue entirely, I would suggest banning any empty NFT transfers.\n\nFor example, `numNfts` must be bigger than zero [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity/blob/765376fa238bbccd8b1e2e12897c91098c7e5ac6/contracts/core/InfinityExchange.sol#L1042). Also make sure the ERC1155 transferring at least 1 item.\n\n**[nneverlander (Infinity) acknowledged and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity-findings/issues/65#issuecomment-1162896366):**\n> Please check this: https://github.com/infinitydotxyz/exchange-contracts-v2/commit/7f0e195d52165853281b971b8610b27140da6e41\n> \n> No more ERC1155 either.\n> \n> The loop that transfers NFTs already checks for non empty array\n> \n> Not sure of the assessment.\n\n**[HardlyDifficult (judge) decreased severity to Medium and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity-findings/issues/65#issuecomment-1179750238):**\n> This is a great report, appreciate the detail and the PoC code.\n> \n> Given that the call must originate from the match executor, it seems unlikely that it would match with an empty sell order. Additionally it should be easy to filter these when submitted off-chain. With that in mind, lowering this to a Medium risk issue.\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
