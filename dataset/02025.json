  "Content": "# Issue M-5: Incorrect calculation of required gas limit during deposit transaction \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism-judging/issues/9 \n\n## Found by \nHE1M, unforgiven\n\n## Summary\n\nIt is possible to bypass burning the gas on L1 if `_gasLimit` is accurately chosen between 21000 and used gas.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nThe gas that deposit transactions use on L2 is bought on L1 via a gas burn in `ResourceMeterin.sol`:\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L432\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L162\n\nThere is also a condition on the parameter `_gasLimit` to protect against DoS attack:\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L443\n\nBut, by using this limitation, it does not enforce to burn correct amount of gas on L1. Because, if the following condition is satisfied, the user will not burn any gas for the transaction on L2 (it only pays gas for the L1 transaction):\n\n`21000 <= _gasLimit <= [usedGas * max(block.basefee, 1 gwei) / prevBaseFee]`\n\nThe condition `21000 <= _gasLimit` will satisfy the condtion:\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L443\n\nThe condition `_gasLimit <= [usedGas * max(block.basefee, 1 gwei) / prevBaseFee]` will bypass the condition (so no gas will be burned on L1):\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L161-L163\n\nFor instance, if a user provides a long bytes as `_data` parameter, the `usedGas` will be increased, so the margin between 21000 to `[usedGas * max(block.basefee, 1 gwei) / prevBaseFee]` will be increased as well. By choosing a `_gasLimit` in this range, the burning gas mechanism can be bypassed. If the `_gasLimit` is set to the minimum allowed value (21000), this transaction will be failed most probably on L2 due to not enough gas limit. All in all, the sequencer would not be compensated although he processed a long data.\n\n## Impact\n - Using L2 resources without enough compensation.\n - DoS \n## Code Snippet\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIt is recommended to include the `_data` length as well as 21000 to the lower bound of gas limit:\n```solidity\nrequire(_gasLimit >= 21_000 + _data.length * 16, \"OptimismPortal: gas limit must cover instrinsic gas cost\");\n```\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**GalloDaSballo**\n\nSidestepping of cost, no loss of principal, agree with Med\n\n",
