  "Title": "Gas Estimation Can Fail in finalizeWithdrawalTransaction",
  "Content": "The `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` [function](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/blob/e29d360904db5e5ec81888885f7b7250f8255895/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L336) of the `OptimismPortal` contract has been slightly changed from the original Optimism's code to accommodate the changes required to bridge MNT, separately from the bridging of other assets. Like many other functions within the contract, the function is supposed to [revert](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/blob/e29d360904db5e5ec81888885f7b7250f8255895/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L432) whenever an external call fails and the `tx.origin` is the `ESTIMATION_ADDRESS`. Conversely, if the external call did not fail, the call should not revert even if the `tx.origin` is the `ESTIMATION_ADDRESS`.\n\n\nAs a result of the changes introduced, the original Optimism behavior is not maintained anymore. Now, even if the external call does not fail and the `tx.origin` is the `ESTIMATION_ADDRESS`, the `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` execution can still fail if the only asset being bridged is ETH. This is because the boolean flagging of whether the MNT transfer was successful or not defaults to `false`, making the call revert. However, this should not happen if no MNT are being transferred. The correct fix would be to set the `l1mntSuccess` [boolean](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/blob/e29d360904db5e5ec81888885f7b7250f8255895/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L416) by default to `true` so that the same Optimism behavior is maintained, but this can also render the boolean useless as mentioned in [issue N01](#n01).\n\n\nConsider making the gas estimation behavior consistent with what has been inherited from Optimism and left unchanged in other parts of the codebase. When doing so, consider the mentioned issue about useless boolean variables being used.\n\n\n***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #105](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/pull/105) at commit [6022c06](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle-v2/tree/6022c060b1baaa1f1c2e60df1136083917d92bb3).*\n\n\n",
