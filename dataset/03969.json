  "Title": "[L12] increaseSupply in GoldToken does not emit Transfer event",
  "Content": "When the total supply of Celo Gold tokens increases, the [`increaseSupply`](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L179) function is called to update the [`totalSupply_`](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/7be22605e172ca536c028e408b147aab83202e4a/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L18) to keep it synchronized with the total amount of gold in the system. This function is not triggering the `Transfer` event, and thus the increase in the quantity of tokens is not being logged.\n\n\nClients attempting to reconstruct the entire history of transferred gold tokens by parsing `Transfer` event logs should take this issue into account to avoid mismatches in expected token balances. Additionally, emitting a `Transfer` event upon token creation is [encouraged by the ERC20 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#transfer-1).\n\n\nConsider modifying the `increaseSupply` function so it receives the `to` address, and consider and emitting the `Transfer` event from `address(0)` to that address.\n\n\n****Update:*** Not Fixed. cLabs’ statement for this issue:*\n\n\n\n> \n> Because native transfers are not tracked through events, only those made through the ERC20 contracts, it should not be expected that a user could track all gold in existence by replaying event logs.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n",
