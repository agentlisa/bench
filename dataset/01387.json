  "Content": "##### Description\nUsers can take two or more flashloans and bypass the requirement of the `maxFlashLoan()` size.\n- https://github.com/prisma-fi/prisma-contracts/blob/52b26b8a2f1904b048754d5443e08d2144610b92/contracts/core/DebtToken.sol#L155C14-L157\n\nThe current cap for flashloans is set to `2**128`.\nIf this check aims to limit the flashloan amount in order not to exceed max totalSupply, take into account that OpenZeppelin´s ERC20 will not allow new totalSupply overflow `2**256` limit.\n- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/f29307cfe08c7d76d96a38bf94bab5fec223c943/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L243\n\n##### Recommendation\nWe recommend either removing this check or introducing a reentrancy protection for the flashloan function only.\n",
