This can happen either when an owner creates a new position or when a transformation occurs.\n\nFor this issue, we'll focus on the second case, specifically when a position is going through a transformation, which creates a new position token. In such a case, we have `tokenId != oldTokenId`, and the else block is run, as shown below:\n\n```solidity\nfunction onERC721Received(address, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data)\n    external\n    override\n    returns (bytes4)\n{\n    ...\n\n    if {\n        ...\n    } else {\n        uint256 oldTokenId = transformedTokenId;\n\n        // if in transform mode - and a new position is sent - current position is replaced and returned\n        if (tokenId != oldTokenId) {\n            address owner = tokenOwner[oldTokenId];\n\n            // set transformed token to new one\n            transformedTokenId = tokenId;\n\n            // copy debt to new token\n            loans[tokenId] = Loan(loans[oldTokenId].debtShares);\n\n            _addTokenToOwner(owner, tokenId);\n            emit Add(tokenId, owner, oldTokenId);\n\n            // clears data of old loan\n            _cleanupLoan(oldTokenId, debtExchangeRateX96, lendExchangeRateX96, owner);\n\n            //@audit can reenter with onERC721Received and call repay or borrow to call _updateAndCheckCollateral twice and manipulate collateral token configs\n\n            // sets data of new loan\n            _updateAndCheckCollateral(\n                tokenId, debtExchangeRateX96, lendExchangeRateX96, 0, loans[tokenId].debtShares\n            );\n        }\n    }\n\n    return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;\n}\n```\n\nWe should note that the `_cleanupLoan` function does return the old position token to the owner:\n\n```solidity\nfunction _cleanupLoan(\n    uint256 tokenId,\n    uint256 debtExchangeRateX96,\n    uint256 lendExchangeRateX96,\n    address owner\n) internal {\n    _removeTokenFromOwner(owner, tokenId);\n    _updateAndCheckCollateral(\n        tokenId,\n        debtExchangeRateX96,\n        lendExchangeRateX96,\n        loans[tokenId].debtShares,\n        0\n    );\n    delete loans[tokenId];\n    nonfungiblePositionManager.safeTransferFrom(\n        address(this),\n        owner,\n        tokenId\n    );\n    emit Remove(tokenId, owner);\n}\n```\n\nThe issue that can occur is that the `_cleanupLoan` is invoked before the `_updateAndCheckCollateral` call. So, a malicious owner can use the `onERC721Received` callback when receiving the old token to call the `borrow` function, which makes changes to `loans[tokenId].debtShares` and calls `_updateAndCheckCollateral`. When the call resumes, the `V3Vault.onERC721Received` function will call `_updateAndCheckCollateral` again, resulting in incorrect accounting of internal token configs debt shares (`tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares` & `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares`) and potentially impacting the vault borrowing process negatively.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nLet's use the following scenario to demonstrate the issue:\n\nBefore starting, we suppose the following states:\n\n- `tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares = 10000`\n- `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares = 15000`\n\n1. Bob has previously deposited a UniswapV3 position (which uses `token0` and `token1`) with `tokenId = 12` and borrowed `loans[tokenId = 12].debtShares = 1000` debt shares.\n\n2. Bob calls the `transform` function to change the range of his position using the AutoRange transformer, which mints a new ERC721 token `tokenId = 20` for the newly arranged position and sends it to the vault.\n\n3. Upon receiving the new token, the `V3Vault.onERC721Received` function is triggered. As we're in transformation mode and the token ID is different, the second else block above will be executed.\n\n4. `V3Vault.onERC721Received` will copy loan debt shares to the new token, so we'll have `loans[tokenId = 20].debtShares = 1000`.\n\n5. Then `V3Vault.onERC721Received` will invoke the `_cleanupLoan` function to clear the data of the old loan and transfer the old position token `tokenId = 12` back to Bob.\n\n    - 5.1. `_cleanupLoan` will also call `_updateAndCheckCollateral` function to change `oldShares = 1000 --> newShares = 0` (remove old token shares), resulting in:\n\n        - `tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares = 10000 - 1000 = 9000`.\n        - `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares = 15000 - 1000 = 14000`.\n\n6.  Bob, upon receiving the old position token, will also use the ERC721 `onERC721Received` callback to call the `borrow` function. He will borrow 200 debt shares against his new position token `tokenId = 20`.\n\n    - 6.1. The `borrow` function will update the token debt shares from `loans[tokenId = 20].debtShares = 1000` to: `loans[tokenId = 20].debtShares = 1000 + 200 = 1200` (assuming the position is healthy).\n\n    - 6.2. The `borrow` function will also invoke the `_updateAndCheckCollateral` function to change `oldShares = 1000 --> newShares = 1200` for `tokenId = 20`, resulting in:\n\n        - `tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares = 9000 + 200 = 9200`.\n        - `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares = 14000 + 200 = 14200`.\n\n7.  Bob's borrow call ends, and the `V3Vault.onERC721Received` call resumes. `_updateAndCheckCollateral` gets called again, changing `oldShares = 0 --> newShares = 1200` (as the borrow call changed the token debt shares), resulting in:\n\n    - `tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares = 9200 + 1200 = 10400`.\n    - `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares = 14200 + 1200 = 15400`.\n\nNow, let's assess what Bob managed to achieve by taking a normal/honest transformation process (without using the `onERC721Received` callback) and then a borrow operation scenario:\n\n- Normally, when `V3Vault.onERC721Received` is called, it shouldn't change the internal token configs debt shares (`tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares` & `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares`). After a normal `V3Vault.onERC721Received`, we should still have:\n\n    - `tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares = 10000`.\n    - `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares = 15000`.\n\n- Then, when Bob borrows 200 debt shares against the new token, we should get:\n\n    - `tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares = 10000 + 200 = 10200`.\n    - `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares = 15000 + 200 = 15200`.\n\nWe observe that by using the `onERC721Received` callback, Bob managed to increase the internal token configs debt shares (`tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares` & `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares`) by 200 debt shares more than expected.\n\nThis means that Bob, by using this attack, has manipulated the internal token configs debt shares, making the vault believe it has 200 additional debt shares. Bob can repeat this attack multiple times until he approaches the limit represented by `collateralValueLimitFactorX32` and `collateralValueLimitFactorX32` multiplied by the amount of asset lent as shown below:\n\n```solidity\nuint256 lentAssets = _convertToAssets(\n    totalSupply(),\n    lendExchangeRateX96,\n    Math.Rounding.Up\n);\nuint256 collateralValueLimitFactorX32 = tokenConfigs[token0]\n    .collateralValueLimitFactorX32;\nif (\n    collateralValueLimitFactorX32 < type(uint32).max &&\n    _convertToAssets(\n        tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares,\n        debtExchangeRateX96,\n        Math.Rounding.Up\n    ) >\n    (lentAssets * collateralValueLimitFactorX32) / Q32\n) {\n    revert CollateralValueLimit();\n}\ncollateralValueLimitFactorX32 = tokenConfigs[token1]\n    .collateralValueLimitFactorX32;\nif (\n    collateralValueLimitFactorX32 < type(uint32).max &&\n    _convertToAssets(\n        tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares,\n        debtExchangeRateX96,\n        Math.Rounding.Up\n    ) >\n    (lentAssets * collateralValueLimitFactorX32) / Q32\n) {\n    revert CollateralValueLimit();\n}\n```\n\nThen, when other borrowers try to call the `borrow` function, it will revert because `_updateAndCheckCollateral` will trigger the `CollateralValueLimit` error, thinking there is too much debt already. However, this is not the case, as the internal token configs debt shares have been manipulated (increased) by an attacker (Bob).\n\nThis attack is irreversible because there is no way to correct the internal token configs debt shares (`tokenConfigs[token0].totalDebtShares` & `tokenConfigs[token1].totalDebtShares`), and the vault will remain in that state, not allowing users to borrow, resulting in no interest being accrued and leading to financial losses for the lenders and the protocol.\n\n### Impact\n\nA malicious attacker could use the AutoRange transformation process to manipulate the internal token configs debt shares, potentially resulting in:\n\n- Fewer loans being allowed by the vault than expected.\n- A complete denial-of-service (DOS) for all borrow operations.\n\n### Tools Used\n\nVS Code\n\n### Recommended Mitigation\n\nThe simplest way to address this issue is to ensure that the `onERC721Received` function follows the Correctness by Construction (CEI) pattern, as follows:\n\n```diff\nfunction onERC721Received(address, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data)\n    external\n    override\n    returns (bytes4)\n{\n    ...\n\n    if {\n        ...\n    } else {\n        uint256 oldTokenId = transformedTokenId;\n\n        // if in transform mode - and a new position is sent - current position is replaced and returned\n        if (tokenId != oldTokenId) {\n            address owner = tokenOwner[oldTokenId];\n\n            // set transformed token to new one\n            transformedTokenId = tokenId;\n\n            // copy debt to new token\n            loans[tokenId] = Loan(loans[oldTokenId].debtShares);\n\n            _addTokenToOwner(owner, tokenId);\n            emit Add(tokenId, owner, oldTokenId);\n\n--          // clears data of old loan\n--          _cleanupLoan(oldTokenId, debtExchangeRateX96, lendExchangeRateX96, owner);\n\n            // sets data of new loan\n            _updateAndCheckCollateral(\n                tokenId, debtExchangeRateX96, lendExchangeRateX96, 0, loans[tokenId].debtShares\n            );\n\n++          // clears data of old loan\n++          _cleanupLoan(oldTokenId, debtExchangeRateX96, lendExchangeRateX96, owner);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;\n}\n```\n\n### Assessed type\n\nContext\n\n**[kalinbas (Revert) confirmed via duplicate Issue #309](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-revert-lend-findings/issues/309#issuecomment-2020917444):**\n\n**[Revert mitigated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-revert-mitigation?tab=readme-ov-file#scope):**\n> PRs [here](https://github.com/revert-finance/lend/pull/8) and [here](https://github.com/revert-finance/lend/pull/32) - removed sending of NFT to avoid reentrancy.\n\n**Status:** Mitigation confirmed.
