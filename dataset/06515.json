  "Content": "\nInternal functions in Solidity are only intended to be invoked within the contract or by other internal functions. If an internal function is not called anywhere within the contract, it serves no purpose and contributes unnecessary overhead during deployment. Removing such functions can lead to substantial gas savings.\n\n```solidity\n19     function transferRewards(address _asset, address _rewardsContract) internal returns (uint256 balance)\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/main/src/rewards/depots/RewardsDepot.sol#L19\n\n",
