  "Content": "\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/strategies/votium/VotiumStrategy.sol#L135\n\nA malicious user can call `relock()` to front-run a transaction to `requestWithdraw()`. \n\nRelocking will take any available CVX in the contract and expired locks in CvxLocker and relock them. Griefed users will need to wait more, as any of the available balance that could have been used for the withdrawal has been relocked as part of the front-running.\n\n",
