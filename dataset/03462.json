  "Title": "[H01] Concurrent relays deplete reserves",
  "Content": "The `relayDeposit` function of the `BridgePool` contract [ensures the contract has sufficient funds](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/4cbb0986d80dfbb351caaadf203d74f0c50b4db8/packages/core/contracts/insured-bridge/BridgePool.sol#L423-L426) to execute the transfer. However, it does not account for [the pending reserves](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/f24ad501c8e813cf685f72217e7f13c8f3c366df/packages/core/contracts/insured-bridge/BridgePool.sol#L51), which tracks funds that are earmarked for active relays. Therefore, multiple simultaneous relays may rely on the same funds, and they may not all be settleable immediately. In particular, with a steady stream of transfers, instant relayer returns may be delayed indefinitely.\n\n\nConsider preventing relays that would cause the pending reserves to exceed the liquid reserves.\n\n\n**Update:** *Fixed as of commit [`6290f3facbca8d878605a1d390ed59d4b6b6db02`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/3501/commits/6290f3facbca8d878605a1d390ed59d4b6b6db02) in [PR3501](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/3501).*\n\n\n",
