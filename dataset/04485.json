  "Title": "Global operators are not restricted to contract addresses",
  "Content": "The Solo contract allows “global operators” to operate on behalf of any account. The motivation behind the global operator feature is to allow for things such as a wrapped Ether proxy and automatic loan expiry. Because the intention is for the global operator to always be a contract, consider adding a sanity check using OpenZeppelin’s [`isContract()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/v2.2.0/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L14) function to ensure regular accounts can not be added as global operators and to be more explicit about the intention of the feature.\n\n\n",
