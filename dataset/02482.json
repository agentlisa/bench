  "Content": "# Issue M-12: Deposits from L1 to L2 using L1CrossDomainMessenger will fail and will not be replayable when L2CrossDomainMessenger is paused \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism-judging/issues/57 \n\n## Found by \nrvierdiiev, Bnke0x0, 0xdeadbeef\n\n## Summary\nDeposits from L1 to L2 using L1CrossDomainMessenger will fail and will not be replayable when L2CrossDomainMessenger is paused.\n## Vulnerability Detail\nBoth `L1CrossDomainMessenger` and `L2CrossDomainMessenger` extend `CrossDomainMessenger` contract that [can be paused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L46).\n\nWhen `CrossDomainMessenger` is paused then only `relayMessage` function [will revert](relayMessage) as it uses `whenNotPaused` modifier. It's still possible to call `sendMessage` when contract is paused.\n\nIn known issues section you can find following:\n> 3.If the L1CrossDomainMessenger is paused, withdrawals sent to it will fail and not be replayable.\n\nHowever there is another problem with pausing.\nIn case if `L2CrossDomainMessenger` is paused and no matter if `L1CrossDomainMessenger` is pause or not(as `sendMessage` function is callable when contract is paused), then all deposits that are coming from L1 to L2 through the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` will fail on L2 side, as `relayMessage` will revert, because is paused.\nAs result, it will be not possible for depositor to replay that deposit anymore as no information about the call is saved.\nAll sent value will be minted to aliased `L2CrossDomainMessenger` address.\n\nExample.\n1.User wants to send himself some eth from L1 to L2 through `L1CrossDomainMessenger`.\n2.When new `TransactionDeposited` event was fired by `OptimismPortal`, `L2CrossDomainMessenger` on L2 was paused for some reasons.\n3.`TransactionDeposited` was explored by special service that sent tx to L2 node.\n4.Sent value amount is minted to aliased `L2CrossDomainMessenger` address and `L2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage` is called which reverts.\n5.Depositor lost his eth as he is not able to replay tx.\n## Impact\nLose of funds for depositor.\n## Code Snippet\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L212-L343\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\nPause `CrossDomainMessenger` on both sides at same time(L1 and L2) and restrict call of `sendMessage` function when contract is paused.\n\n## Discussion\n\n**rcstanciu**\n\nComment from Optimism\n\n---\n\n **Description:** lock ups on l1->l2 pausing\n\n\n\n\n\n",
