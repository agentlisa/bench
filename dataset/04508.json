  "Title": "Missing zero address checks",
  "Content": "In several places in the code, addresses are passed as parameters to functions. In many of these instances, the functions do not validate that the passed address is not the address `0`. In the `Controller` contract, this happens in functions [`configureController`](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/4b9ebf3941a48e41e7363fee729035610a71ca66/contracts/minting/Controller.sol#L56) (which only checks `_worker`) and [`removeController`](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/4b9ebf3941a48e41e7363fee729035610a71ca66/contracts/minting/Controller.sol#L66).\n\n\nIn the [`MintController`](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/4b9ebf3941a48e41e7363fee729035610a71ca66/contracts/minting/MintController.sol) contract, on the other hand, it might be expected that the constructor sets the `minterManager` variable to `0`, but the [`setMinterManager`](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/4b9ebf3941a48e41e7363fee729035610a71ca66/contracts/minting/MintController.sol#L60) function does not prevent setting it to `0`.\n\n\nWhile this does not currently pose a security risk, consider adding checks for the passed addresses being nonzero to prevent unexpected behavior where required, or documenting the fact that a zero address is indeed a valid parameter.\n\n\n***Update:*** *functions in* `Controller` *now check* [*all*](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/fbb6cfeb503ece6719cd456f82e6ef1602145db3/contracts/minting/Controller.sol#L85) [*passed*](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/fbb6cfeb503ece6719cd456f82e6ef1602145db3/contracts/minting/Controller.sol#L87) [*arguments*](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/fbb6cfeb503ece6719cd456f82e6ef1602145db3/contracts/minting/Controller.sol#L102) *to prevent zero addresses from being set. No changes were introduced in this respect in* `MintController`.\n\n\n",
