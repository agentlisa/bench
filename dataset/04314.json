  "Title": "[L10] Transfer of ETH may unexpectedly fail",
  "Content": "The [`withdraw` function](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/common/implementation/Withdrawable.sol#L20) of the `Withdrawable` contract allows authorized callers to withdraw any amount of ETH from the contract. The transfer of Ether is executed with Solidity’s `transfer` function, which forwards a limited amount of gas to the receiver. Should the receiver be a contract with a fallback function that needs more than 2300 units of gas to execute, the transfer of Ether would inevitably fail. After the Istanbul hard fork, it has become a [recommended practice not to use `transfer`](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/) to avoid hard dependencies on specific gas costs.\n\n\nTo avoid unexpected failures in the withdrawal of Ether, consider replacing `transfer` with the [`sendValue` function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.0.0-beta.0/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L63) available in the OpenZeppelin Contracts library.\n\n\n**Update:** *Fixed in [PR#1225](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/1225).*\n\n\n",
