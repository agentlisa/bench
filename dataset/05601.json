Let's start with the fees.\n\nLenders earn interest with two different types of fees: Base interest and delinquency fee. The base interest depends on the annual interest rate of the market and it is paid by the borrower no matter what. On the other hand, the delinquency fee is a penalty fee and it is paid by the borrower if the reserves of the market drop below the required reserves amount.\n\nThe important part is how the penalty fees are calculated and I'll be focusing on penalty fees at the moment. Every market has a delinquency grace period, which is a period that is not penalized. If a market is delinquent but the grace period is not passed yet, there is no penalty fee. After the grace period is passed, the penalty fee is applied.\n\nThe most crucial part starts now. The penalty fee does not become `0` immediately after the delinquency is cured. The penalty fee is still being applied, even after the delinquency is cured, until the grace tracker counts down to zero.\n\nAn example from the protocol [gitbook/borrowers section is](https://wildcat-protocol.gitbook.io/wildcat/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers): *\"Note: this means that if a markets grace period is 3 days, and it takes 5 days to cure delinquency, this means that* ***4*** *days of penalty APR are paid.\"*\n\n[Here](<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/libraries/FeeMath.sol#L89>), you can find the code snippet of penalty fee calculation.\n\nNow, let's check how to close a market. Here is the `closeMarket()` function:\n\n```solidity\nfile: WildcatMarket.sol\n142.  function closeMarket() external onlyController nonReentrant {\n143.    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();\n144.    state.annualInterestBips = 0;\n145.    state.isClosed = true;\n146.    state.reserveRatioBips = 0;\n147.    if (_withdrawalData.unpaidBatches.length() > 0) {\n148.      revert CloseMarketWithUnpaidWithdrawals();\n149.    }\n150.    uint256 currentlyHeld = totalAssets();\n151.@>  uint256 totalDebts = state.totalDebts(); //@audit-issue Current debt is calculated with the current scaleFactor. It doesn't check if there are remaining \"state.timeDelinquent\" to pay penalty fees. \n152.    if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {\n153.      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower\n154.@>    asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld); //@audit remaining debt is transferred and market is closed, but if the market was delinquent for a while, debt will keep increasing. Total assets will not cover the total debt\n155.    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {\n156.      // Transfer excess assets to borrower\n157.      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);\n158.    }\n159.    _writeState(state);\n160.    emit MarketClosed(block.timestamp);\n161.  }\n```\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat/blob/c5df665f0bc2ca5df6f06938d66494b11e7bdada/src/market/WildcatMarket.sol#L142C1-L161C4>\n\nWhile closing the market, the total debt is calculated and the required amount is transferred to the market. This way all debts are covered. However, the covered total debt is calculated with the current scale factor. As you can see above, this function does not check if there are still penalties to be paid. It should have checked the `state.timeDelinquent`.\n\nIf the `state.timeDelinquent > grace period` when closing the market *(which means the borrower still has more penalties to pay)*, the scale factor will keep increasing after every state update.\n\nThe borrower didn't pay the remaining penalties when closing the market, but who will pay it?\n\n- Lenders will keep earning those penalty fees (*the base rate will be `0` after closing, but the penalty fee will still accumulate*)\n- Lenders will start withdrawing their funds.\n- All lenders except the last one will withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed + the penalty fee after closing`.\n- The last lender will not even be able to withdraw `the exact debt to the lender when closed` because some portion of the funds dedicated to the last lender are already transferred to the previous lenders as the penalty fee.\n\nThe borrower might intentionally do it to escape from the penalty, or the borrower may not even be aware of the situation.\n\n1.  The borrower had a cash flow problem after taking the debt.\n2.  The market stayed delinquent for a long time.\n3.  The borrower found some funds.\n4.  The borrower wanted to close the high-interest debts right after finding some funds.\n5.  Immediately paid everything and closed the market while the market was still delinquent.\n6.  From the borrower's perspective, they paid all of their debt while closing the market.\n7.  But in reality, the borrower only paid half of the penalty fee (while the counter was counting up). But the second half of the penalties, which will be accumulated while the counter was counting down, is not paid by the borrower.\n\nThe protocol does not check if there are remaining penalties and doesn't charge the borrower enough while closing the market.\n\nI provided a coded PoC below that shows every step of the vulnerability.\n\n### Impact\n\n- The borrower will pay only half of the penalty while closing the market.\n- The other half of the penalty will keep accumulating.\n- One of the lenders (the last one to withdraw) will have to cover those unpaid penalties.\n\nBorrowers who are aware of this may create charming markets with lower base rate but higher penalty rate (they know they won't pay the half of it). Or the borrowers may not be aware of this, but the protocol doesn't take the required penalty from them. They \"unintentionally\" do not pay the penalty, but the lender will have to cover it.\n\n### Coded PoC\n\nYou can use the protocol's own test setup to prove this issue:\n\n- Copy the snippet below, and paste it into the `WildcatMarket.t.sol` test file.\n- Run it with `forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty -vvv`\n\n```solidity\n// @audit Not pay the half, leave it to the last lender\n  function test_closeMarket_withoutPaying_HalfofThePenalty() external {\n    // -----------------------------------------CHAPTER ONE - PREPARE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    // ------------------------------DEPOSIT - BORROW - WITHDRAW -> MARKET IS DELINQUENT-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    // Alice and Bob deposit 50k each, borrower borrows 80% \n    _authorizeLender(bob);\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.depositUpTo(50_000e18);\n    vm.prank(borrower);\n    market.borrow(80_000e18);\n    \n    // Alice and Bob request withdrawal for 10k each, reserve will be 0, market will be delinquent.\n    vm.prank(alice);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    vm.prank(bob);\n    market.queueWithdrawal(10_000e18);\n    // skip withdrawal batch duration\n    skip(1 days);\n    market.executeWithdrawal(alice, 86401); //86401 is the batch expiry.

This can easily be done by checking `state.timeDelinquent` in the `closeMarket()` function.\n\nThat one is simple, but I don't think it is fair for the borrower, as they will have to pay the base rate as well, for that additional amount of time. Maybe the borrower will be inclined to pay the `current debt + future penalties` and close the market as soon as possible.\n\nThat's why I think closing the market can still be allowed, even if there are penalties to accumulate. However, the problem is we can not know the exact amount of future penalties due to the compounding mechanism. It will depend on how many times the state is updated while the grace counter counts down.\n\nTherefore, I believe a buffer amount should be added. If the borrowers want to close the market, they should pay `current debt + expected future penalties + buffer amount`, and the excess amount from the buffer should be transferred back to the borrower after every lender withdraws their funds.\n\n### Assessed type\n\nContext\n\n**[laurenceday (Wildcat) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat-findings/issues/506#issuecomment-1803365888):**\n > We decided to permit borrowers to close markets if delinquent and just zero out `state.timeDelinquent`, returning everything outstanding at that moment and ending things there. It's preferable from the POV of the lender to just be able to access their notional and interest ASAP, rather than wait for the timer to run back down to within the grace period. There's no alternative 'good' solution to this that isn't particularly fiddly given the way in which interest compounds.\n> \n> The suggested solution would require that people waited until the market was out of delinquency before the scale factor caught up when only the penalty rate applied, so they could redeem for the extra amount due to them: this could be a *long* time if the situation leading up to a market closure after going delinquent is a protracted one.\n> \n> Mitigated [here](https://github.com/wildcat-finance/wildcat-protocol/pull/57/commits/292ebda50008062dac0c5acbffe45639143fadd1).\n\n**[laurenceday (Wildcat) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-wildcat-findings/issues/506#issuecomment-1810757994)**\n\n***\n\n",
