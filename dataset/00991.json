  "Title": "`IdRegistry.transfer/transferFor()` might be revoked by a recovery address.",
  "Content": "**Severity:** Medium\n\n**Description:** In every `fid`, there exists an owner and a recovery address, each possessing identical authority, enabling either one to modify the other.\nBut while transferring the `fid`, it just changes the owner and this scenario might be possible.\n\n- Consider Bob with a `fid(owner, recovery)` intending to sell it.\n- After receiving some funds, he transfers his `fid` to an honest user using `transfer()`.\n- When the honest user is going to update the recovery address, Bob calls `recover()` by front running and seizes the account.\n- In contrast to ERC721, a recovery address acts like an approved user for the NFT, empowered to change ownership at any moment. Notably, this authority is cleared during the [transfer](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L252) to prevent subsequent updates by any prior approvals.\n\n**Impact:** `IdRegistry.transfer/transferFor()` might be revoked by a recovery address.\n\n**Recommended Mitigation:** Recommend adding a function like `transferAll()` to update both `owner/recovery`.\n\n**Client:**\nFixed by adding `transferAndChangeRecovery` and `transferAndChangeRecoveryFor` to `IdRegistry`.
