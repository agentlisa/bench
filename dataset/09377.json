  "Content": "_Submitted by IllIllI_\n\nA malicious authorized user can steal all unclaimed rewards and break the reward accounting\n\nEven if the authorized user is benevolent the fact that there is a rug vector available may [negatively impact the protocol's reputation](https://twitter.com/RugDocIO/status/1411732108029181960). Furthermore since this contract is meant to be used by other projects, the trustworthiness of every project cannot be vouched for.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nBy setting a booster that returns zero for all calls to `boostedBalanceOf()` where the `user` address is not under the attacker's control, and returning arbitrary values for those under his/her control, an attacker can choose specific amounts of `rewardToken` to assign to himself/herself. The attacker can then call `claimRewards()` to withdraw the funds. Any amounts that the attacker assigns to himself/herself over the amount that normally would have been assigned, upon claiming, is taken from other users' unclaimed balances, since tokens are custodied by the `flywheelRewards` address rather than per-user accounts.\n\n```solidity\nFile: flywheel-v2/src/FlywheelCore.sol\n\n182       /// @notice swap out the flywheel booster contract\n183       function setBooster(IFlywheelBooster newBooster) external requiresAuth {\n184           flywheelBooster = newBooster;\n185   \n186           emit FlywheelBoosterUpdate(address(newBooster));\n187       }\n```\n\n[FlywheelCore.sol#L182-L187](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/FlywheelCore.sol#L182-L187)<br>\n\n```solidity\nFile: flywheel-v2/src/FlywheelCore.sol\n\n258           uint256 supplierTokens = address(flywheelBooster) != address(0)\n259               ? flywheelBooster.boostedBalanceOf(strategy, user)\n260               : strategy.balanceOf(user);\n261   \n262           // accumulate rewards by multiplying user tokens by rewardsPerToken index and adding on unclaimed\n263           uint256 supplierDelta = (supplierTokens * deltaIndex) / ONE;\n264           uint256 supplierAccrued = rewardsAccrued[user] + supplierDelta;\n265   \n266           rewardsAccrued[user] = supplierAccrued;\n```\n\n[FlywheelCore.sol#L258-L266](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/FlywheelCore.sol#L258-L266)<br>\n\n```solidity\nFile: flywheel-v2/src/FlywheelCore.sol\n\n119       function claimRewards(address user) external {\n120           uint256 accrued = rewardsAccrued[user];\n121   \n122           if (accrued != 0) {\n123               rewardsAccrued[user] = 0;\n124   \n125               rewardToken.safeTransferFrom(address(flywheelRewards), user, accrued);\n```\n\n[FlywheelCore.sol#L119-L125](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/FlywheelCore.sol#L119-L125)<br>\n\nProjects also using `BaseFlywheelRewards` or its child contrats, are implicitly approving infinite transfers by the core\n\n```solidity\nFile: flywheel-v2/src/rewards/BaseFlywheelRewards.sol\n\n25        constructor(FlywheelCore _flywheel) {\n26            flywheel = _flywheel;\n27            ERC20 _rewardToken = _flywheel.rewardToken();\n28            rewardToken = _rewardToken;\n29    \n30            _rewardToken.safeApprove(address(_flywheel), type(uint256).max);\n31        }\n```\n\n[BaseFlywheelRewards.sol#L25-L31](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/rewards/BaseFlywheelRewards.sol#L25-L31)<br>\n\nThe attacker need not keep the booster set this way - he/she can set it, call `accrue()` for his/her specific user, and unset it, all in the same block.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nMake `flywheelRewards` immutable, or only allow it to change if there are no current users.\n\n**[Joeysantoro (xTRIBE) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-xtribe-findings/issues/23#issuecomment-1110489785):**\n > This is a similar issue to one which already affects the SushiSwap masterchef. If rewards are decreased without first calling the `accrue`-equivalent on the masterchef, then previous rewards are lost.\n> \n> If trust minimization is a desired property (in my opinion it is), then these functions should be behind timelocks.\n> \n> If a user can call accrue before the booster is updated, they can lock in past rewards as they are added onto the rewardsAccrued global state var\n> `266           rewardsAccrued[user] = supplierAccrued;`\n>\n > I don't really see this as a vulnerability, but will leave it to the C4 judge.\n\n**[0xean (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-xtribe-findings/issues/23#issuecomment-1130780752):**\n > I do see this as a vulnerability. Essentially, there is a backdoor by which a privileged address can extract value from users.  A timelock would be a potential solution to mitigate some of the risk, as well as the mitigation options presented by the warden. \n> \n> `\n> 2 — Med: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.\n> `\n> \n> This is a hypothetical attack path with external requirements and deserves the medium severity rating. \n\n\n\n***\n\n",
