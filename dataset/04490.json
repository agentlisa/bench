  "Title": "Using Wei to refer to the minimum unit of a token",
  "Content": "The Solo project uses the word “Wei” to refer to the minimum and indivisible unit of a token. 1 wei in Ethereum is equal to 10^-18 ether. While most tokens follow the same convention of having a “human-readable” unit with 18 decimals, many tokens define a different number of decimals. In addition to that, most tokens leave their minimum unit nameless, using the prefix of the International System of Units to refer to it (for example, attoToken for 1 token \\* 10^-18), instead of calling it Wei. This important detail is only [mentioned once in the codebase](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/solo/blob/17df84db351d5438e1b7437572722b4f52c8b2b4/contracts/protocol/interfaces/IPriceOracle.sol#L40).\n\n\nThere is no consistent way to call this minimum unit, and it could be very confusing to use Wei when the token has a different number of decimals. Consider using an alternative name that is clearer and less loaded, like BaseUnit or (as [Matt Condon](https://mat.tc/) has suggested) TokenBits. Also consider documenting the expected unit on all the functions that receive a token amount as an argument.\n\n\n",
