  "Title": "[L08] Ownership transfer fails silently",
  "Content": "The [`transferOwnership` function](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/blob/67c0fec95e65fca8d27751f28a6c06e5247978c6/packages/augur-core/source/contracts/libraries/Ownable.sol#L39-L44) of the `Ownable` contract returns a boolean indicating if the transfer succeeds. However, it returns `true` in all cases, even when the `_newOwner` parameter is zero and the contract’s `owner` is not updated. Consider returning `false` in this scenario.\n\n\n**Update**: *Fixed in [commit `550a6511`](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/pull/5567/commits/550a65111b0f065717bd6c7918a4802d8cc42a21).*\n\n\n",
