  "Title": "Ownable’s transferOwnership fails silently",
  "Content": "In [`transferOwnership`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/ico/blob/142f43f3bec4afd0ffff3fce06946cf67cb0272f/contracts/Ownable.sol#L40) there’s a sanity check to see that the address argument is non-zero, which can fail silently. Consider throwing if the check doesn’t pass, by changing the line to `require (newOwner != 0x0);`.\n\n\n**Update:** Hubii replied *“The `transferOwnership` function was modified to require the `newOwner` to be non null.”* Fixed in [`5a90957abf3f792951b3aad66d6eb0317f0500ca`](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/ico/commit/5a90957abf3f792951b3aad66d6eb0317f0500ca).\n\n\n",
