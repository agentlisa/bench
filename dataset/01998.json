This means that collateral can be committed to an already accepted bid, modifying bidCollaterals.\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L393-L409\n\n    function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {\n        for (\n            uint256 i;\n            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();\n            i++\n        ) {\n            // Get collateral info\n            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]\n                .collateralInfo[\n                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)\n                ];\n            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender\n            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(\n                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,\n                collateralInfo._amount,\n                _receiver\n            );\n\nbidCollaterals is used to trigger the withdrawal from the escrow to the receiver, which closing the loan and liquidations. This can be used to DOS a loan AFTER it has already been filled.\n\n1) User A creates a bid for 10 ETH against 50,000 USDC at 10% APR\n2) User B sees this bid and decides to fill it\n3) After the loan is accepted, User A calls CollateralManager#commitCollateral with a malicious token they create\n4) User A doesn't pay their loan and it becomes liquidatable\n5) User B calls liquidate but it reverts when the escrow attempts to transfer out the malicious token\n6) User A demands a ransom to return the funds\n7) User A enables the malicious token transfer once the ransom is paid\n\n## Impact\n\nLoans can be permanently DOS'd even after being accepted \n\n## Code Snippet\n\n[CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130)\n\n[CollateralManager.sol#L138-L147](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L138-L147)\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nCollateralManager#commitCollateral should revert if loan is active.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**ethereumdegen**\n\nThis seems to be a duplicate of the issue that states that the commitCollateral is publicly callable.   A fix is being implemented which will make that function only callable by TellerV2.sol contract which should remedy this vulnerability. Thank you . \n\n**dugdaniels**\n\nEscalate for 10 USDC\n\nAs the sponsor already stated, this should be marked as a duplicate of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/169\n\nThey are the same root cause and the same attack vector.\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n > Escalate for 10 USDC\n> \n> As the sponsor already stated, this should be marked as a duplicate of https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-judging/issues/169\n> \n> They are the same root cause and the same attack vector.\n\nYou've created a valid escalation for 10 USDC!\n\nTo remove the escalation from consideration: Delete your comment.\n\nYou may delete or edit your escalation comment anytime before the 48-hour escalation window closes. After that, the escalation becomes final.\n\n**Trumpero**\n\nI believe this issue is different from #169, and they have different root causes. This issue demonstrates that the `commitCollateral` function can be called on the active loan/ after the accepted bid, to add a malicious token and block liquidation, even when the caller is legitimate (the borrower in scenario).\n\n**ethereumdegen**\n\nThis is fixed by the same fix as 169 \n[fix/sherlock/169](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/tree/fix/sherlock/169)\n\n\n**hrishibhat**\n\nEscalation rejected\n\nThis is a different issue with a different root cause from #169 as pointed out by the Lead Judge\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n> Escalation rejected\n> \n> This is a different issue with a different root cause from #169 as pointed out by the Lead Judge\n\n    This issue's escalations have been rejected!\n\n    Watsons who escalated this issue will have their escalation amount deducted from their next payout.\n\n**IAm0x52**\n\nFixed [here](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/pull/98) by restricting commitCollateral to only be called by TellerV2, which will never call commitCollateral on an active loan\n\n",
