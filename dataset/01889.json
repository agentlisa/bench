  "Content": "# Issue H-11: Oracle price should be denominated in DAI instead of USD \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD-judging/issues/909 \n\n## Found by \nT1MOH, WATCHPUG\n## Summary\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nPer the whitepaper, USSD aims to be pegged to DAI.\n\nThe implementation of rebalancer is also using the DAI price of USSD (`getOwnValuation()`) as the target of the peg.\n\nHowever, all current oracles return the price denominated in USD.\n\nAdditionally, all collateral tokens can be used to mint at the oracle price with no fee.\n\nAs a result, when DAI is over-pegged, the system will automatically drive itself away from the peg to DAI. The proof of concept for this is as follows:\n\nWhen the DAI price is 1.1 (over-pegged), and the system is actively maintaining its peg to DAI, the user can:\n\n1. Mint 1100 USSD with 1000 DAI (worth 1100 USD).\n2. Sell 1100 USSD for 1100 DAI, driving the USSD to a lower price against DAI, say 1 USSD to 0.98 DAI.\n3. Trigger the `rebalance()` function which sells collateral to DAI and buys back USSD to push its price back to 1:1 with DAI.\n\nBy repeating steps 1-3, the system will consume all its collateral, and the profit will be extracted by the arbitrator.\n\n## Impact\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD/blob/main/ussd-contracts/contracts/oracles/StableOracleWETH.sol#L12-L27\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nChange the unit of Oracle price from USD to DAI.\n\n- DAI should return 1\n- WBTC should use WBTC/ETH ETH/DAI\n- WETH should use WETH/DAI\n- WBGL should use WBGL/WETH ETH/DAI\n\nOr, change the peg target from DAI to USD, which means the `getOwnValuation()` should not be used as the peg deviation check standard.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**0xJuancito**\n\nEscalate for 10 USDC\n\nThe report assumes that the attacker would be able to sell 1100 USSD for 1100 DAI:\n\n> 2. Sell 1100 USSD for 1100 DAI, driving the USSD to a lower price against DAI, say 1 USSD to 0.98 DAI.\n\nThis wouldn't be possible, as the USSD/DAI pool would be arbitraged and the attacker will only be losing money on each mint. It also assumes manipulating the price, which is already mentioned in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD-judging/issues/451.\n\nThis can be considered either informational or a duplicate\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\n > Escalate for 10 USDC\n> \n> The report assumes that the attacker would be able to sell 1100 USSD for 1100 DAI:\n> \n> > 2.

After that, the escalation becomes final.\n\n**ctf-sec**\n\nEmm do not see why this is not possible\n\n> Sell 1100 USSD for 1100 DAI, driving the USSD to a lower price against DAI, say 1 USSD to 0.98 DAI.\n\nthe attack path described is still valid in the original report\n\n**hrishibhat**\n\nResult:\nHigh\nHas duplicates\nThe attack is possible and the rebalance is design to create maintain the 1:1 ratio between USSD to DAI.\n\n**sherlock-admin**\n\nEscalations have been resolved successfully!\n\nEscalation status:\n- [0xJuancito](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-USSD-judging/issues/909/#issuecomment-1605924088): rejected\n\n",
