  "Title": "[H-03] StakedCitadel depositors can be attacked by the first depositor with depressing of vault token denomination",
  "Content": "_Submitted by hyh, also found by VAD37, cmichel, 0xDjango, berndartmueller, and danb_\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/main/src/StakedCitadel.sol#L881-L892>\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/main/src/StakedCitadel.sol#L293-L295>\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can become the first depositor for a recently created StakedCitadel contract, providing a tiny amount of Citadel tokens by calling `deposit(1)` (raw values here, `1` is `1 wei`, `1e18` is `1 Citadel` as it has 18 decimals). Then the attacker can directly transfer, for example, `10^6*1e18 - 1` Citadel to StakedCitadel, effectively setting the cost of `1` of the vault token to be `10^6 * 1e18` Citadel. The attacker will still own 100% of the StakedCitadel's pool being the only depositor.\n\nAll subsequent depositors will have their Citadel token investments rounded to `10^6 * 1e18`, due to the lack of precision which initial tiny deposit caused, with the remainder divided between all current depositors, i.e. the subsequent depositors lose value to the attacker.\n\nFor example, if the second depositor brings in `1.9*10^6 * 1e18` Citadel, only `1` of new vault to be issued as `1.9*10^6 * 1e18` divided by `10^6 * 1e18` will yield just `1`, which means that `2.9*10^6 * 1e18` total Citadel pool will be divided 50/50 between the second depositor and the attacker, as each have 1 wei of the total 2 wei of vault tokens, i.e. the depositor lost and the attacker gained `0.45*10^6 * 1e18` Citadel tokens.\n\nAs there are no penalties to exit with StakedCitadel.withdraw(), the attacker can remain staked for an arbitrary time, gathering the share of all new deposits' remainder amounts.\n\nPlacing severity to be high as this is principal funds loss scenario for many users (most of depositors), easily executable, albeit only for the new StakedCitadel contract.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\ndeposit() -> \\_depositFor() -> \\_mintSharesFor() call doesn't require minimum amount and mints according to the provided amount:\n\ndeposit:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/main/src/StakedCitadel.sol#L309-L311>\n\n\\_depositFor:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/main/src/StakedCitadel.sol#L764-L777>\n\n\\_mintSharesFor:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/main/src/StakedCitadel.sol#L881-L892>\n\nWhen StakedCitadel is new the `_pool = balance()` is just initially empty contract balance:\n\n<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel/blob/main/src/StakedCitadel.sol#L293-L295>\n\nAny deposit lower than total attacker's stake will be fully stolen from the depositor as `0` vault tokens will be issued in this case.\n\n### References\n\nThe issue is similar to the `TOB-YEARN-003` one of the Trail of Bits audit of Yearn Finance:\n\n<https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/tree/master/audits/20210719_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2>\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nA minimum for deposit value can drastically reduce the economic viability of the attack. I.e. `deposit() -> ...` can require each amount to surpass the threshold, and then an attacker would have to provide too big direct investment to capture any meaningful share of the subsequent deposits.\n\nAn alternative is to require only the first depositor to freeze big enough initial amount of liquidity. This approach has been used long enough by various projects, for example in Uniswap V2:\n\n<https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L121>\n\n\n**[GalloDaSballo (BadgerDAO) acknowledged, disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel-findings/issues/217#issuecomment-1106938360):**\n > Disagree with the dramatic effect the warden is implying.\n> \n> Agree with the finding as this is a property of vault based systems\n\n > Also worth noting that anyone else can still get more deposits in and get their fair share, it's just that the first deposit would now require a deposit of at least `vault.balanceOf` in order to get the fair amount of shares (which at this point would be rebased to be 1 = `prevBalanceOf`) \n\n**[jack-the-pug (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-badger-citadel-findings/issues/217#issuecomment-1140871615):**\n > I believe this is a valid `High` even though the precondition of this attack is quite strict (the attacker has to be the 1st depositor).\n> \n> The impact is not just a regular precision loss, but with the pricePerShare of the vault being manipulated to an extreme value, all regular users will lose up to the pricePerShare of the deposited amount due to huge precision loss.\n\n\n\n***\n\n \n",
