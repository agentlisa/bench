If it's still in use, any top up action executions will be disabled as reporting fees in `KeeperGauge.sol` will revert:\n\n    function reportFees(\n        address beneficiary,\n        uint256 amount,\n        address lpTokenAddress\n    ) external override returns (bool) {\n        ...\n        require(!killed, Error.CONTRACT_PAUSED); // gauge is killed by InflationManager\n        ...\n        return true;\n    }\n\nIf this happened during extreme market movements, some positions that require a top up will not be executed and be in risk of being liquidated.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n*   Alice registers a top up action.\n*   Governance calls `InflationManager.removeKeeperGauge`, replacing an old keeper gauge. However, governance forgot to call `TopUpActionFeeHandler.prepareKeeperGauge` so `TopUpActionFeeHandler.getKeeperGauge` still points to the killed gauge.\n*   Market moved and Alice's position should now be executed by keepers, however any attempt to execute will revert:\n        > Keeper calls TopUpAction.execute();\n        > _payFees();\n        > IActionFeeHandler(feeHandler).payFees();\n        > IKeeperGauge(keeperGauge).reportFees();\n        > reverts as gauge is already killed\n*   Governance noticed and calls `prepareKeeperGauge`  with a 3 days delay.\n*   Alice's position got liquidated before the change is executed.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider adding an on-chain check to ensure that the keeper gauge is not in use before removing them.\n\n**[danhper (Backd) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/71)** \n\n**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/71#issuecomment-1163180483):**\n > I believe the warden has shown a situation in which calling `_removeKeeperGauge` can cause `payFees` to revert, making it impossible (for a time) for fees to be paid.\n> \n> I do not believe the impact will extend beyond: \n> - Potential loss of yield (or delay)\n> - Need for governance to set a new gauge\n> \n> I disagree with the statement: `Alice's position got liquidated before the change is executed.` as no liquidation should be contingent on fees being paid from this function.\n> \n> Because the finding shows how the system for fees can be stopped due to external conditions, I agree with Medium Seveirty\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
