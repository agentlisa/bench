This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:\n\n*   [Historical Price data](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds)\n*   [Checking Your returned answers](https://docs.chain.link/docs/faq/#how-can-i-check-if-the-answer-to-a-round-is-being-carried-over-from-a-previous-round)\n\nThe result of `latestRoundData` API will be used across various functions, therefore, a stale price from Chainlink can lead to loss of funds to end-users.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider adding the missing checks for stale data.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n(uint80 roundID ,answer,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();\n\nrequire(answer > 0, \"Chainlink price <= 0\"); \nrequire(answeredInRound >= roundID, \"Stale price\");\nrequire(timestamp != 0, \"Round not complete\");\n```\n\n**[Oighty (Olympus) confirmed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus-findings/issues/441#issuecomment-1238528515):**\n > Agree. We'll add the additional checks.\n\n\n\n***\n\n",
