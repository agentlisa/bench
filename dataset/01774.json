  "Title": "3S-LENFT-N05 libraries/types/ConfigTypes.sol: pack InterestRateConfig struct variables to save gas",
  "Content": "#### Description\nCurrently, the [InterestRateConfig](https://github.com/leNFT/contracts/blob/master/contracts/libraries/types/ConfigTypes.sol#L24) struct has the following variables:\n\n```solidity\nstruct InterestRateConfig {\nuint256 optimalUtilizationRate;\nuint256 baseBorrowRate;\nuint256 lowSlope;\nuint256 highSlope;\n}\n```\n\nThese variables are either rates or slopes, with values in the order of magnitude of a few thousand on the test parameters. Since this struct is used quiet frequently and most of the times all the parameters are loaded in the same transaction, packing all these variables into a single storage slot would save a great deal of gas.\n\nStoring these 4 variables as uint64s would still allow them to hold values up to ~1.84e+19, far above the interval required for their application.\n\n#### Recommendation\nChange the struct variable's type from uint256 to uint64.",
