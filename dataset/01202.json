  "Title": "Maximum XVS Staked Does Not Match the Documentation",
  "Content": "The documentation states:\n\n\n\n> The maximum XVS cap taken into account when calculating the score of a user is 100,000 XVS.\n\n\nHowever the constant `[MAXIMUM_XVS_CAP](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/blob/f31a0543da039dab69112c6be3e36ea54959503b/contracts/Tokens/Prime/PrimeStorage.sol#L29)` is set to `10000`. Consider modifying the variable or updating the documentation accordingly.\n\n\n***Update:** Resolved in [pull request #196](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/196)* at commit [860c959](https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/commit/860c9598465b0e67092f838e3c5ee2faf7c1b664).\n\n\n\n",
