  "Content": "# Lines of code\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L179-L190\n\n\n# Vulnerability details\n\nERC721Votes's delegate() and delegateBySig() allow the delegation to zero address, which result in owner's votes elimination in the checkpoint. I.e. the votes are subtracted from the owner, but aren't added anywhere. _moveDelegateVotes() invoked by _delegate() treats the corresponding call as a burning, erasing the votes.\n\nThe impact is that the further transfer and burning attempts for the ids of the owner will be reverted because _afterTokenTransfer() callback will try to reduce owner's votes, which are already zero, reverting the calls due to subtraction fail.\n\nAs ERC721Votes is parent to Token the overall impact is governance token burning and transfer being disabled whenever the owner delegated to zero address. This can be done deliberately, i.e. any owner can disable burning and transfer of the owned ids at any moment, which can interfere with governance voting process.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nUser facing delegate() and delegateBySig() allow for zero address delegation:\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L131-L135\n\n```solidity\n    /// @notice Delegates votes to an account\n    /// @param _to The address delegating votes to\n    function delegate(address _to) external {\n        _delegate(msg.sender, _to);\n    }\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L144-L174\n\n```solidity\n    function delegateBySig(\n        address _from,\n        address _to,\n        uint256 _deadline,\n        uint8 _v,\n        bytes32 _r,\n        bytes32 _s\n    ) external {\n        // Ensure the signature has not expired\n        if (block.timestamp > _deadline) revert EXPIRED_SIGNATURE();\n\n        // Used to store the digest\n        bytes32 digest;\n\n        // Cannot realistically overflow\n        unchecked {\n            // Compute the hash of the domain seperator with the typed delegation data\n            digest = keccak256(\n                abi.encodePacked(\"\\x19\\x01\", DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(), keccak256(abi.encode(DELEGATION_TYPEHASH, _from, _to, nonces[_from]++, _deadline)))\n            );\n        }\n\n        // Recover the message signer\n        address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, _v, _r, _s);\n\n        // Ensure the recovered signer is the voter\n        if (recoveredAddress == address(0) || recoveredAddress != _from) revert INVALID_SIGNATURE();\n\n        // Update the delegate\n        _delegate(_from, _to);\n    }\n```\n\nAnd pass zero address to the _delegate() where it is being set:\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L179-L190\n\n```solidity\n    function _delegate(address _from, address _to) internal {\n        // Get the previous delegate\n        address prevDelegate = delegation[_from];\n\n        // Store the new delegate\n        delegation[_from] = _to;\n\n        emit DelegateChanged(_from, prevDelegate, _to);\n\n        // Transfer voting weight from the previous delegate to the new delegate\n        _moveDelegateVotes(prevDelegate, _to, balanceOf(_from));\n    }\n```\n\nIn this case _moveDelegateVotes() will reduce the votes from the owner, not adding it to anywhere as `_from` is the owner, while `_to` is zero address:\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L203-L220\n\n```solidity\n            if (_from != _to && _amount > 0) {\n                // If this isn't a token mint:\n                if (_from != address(0)) {\n                    // Get the sender's number of checkpoints\n                    uint256 nCheckpoints = numCheckpoints[_from]++;\n\n                    // Used to store the sender's previous voting weight\n                    uint256 prevTotalVotes;\n\n                    // If this isn't the sender's first checkpoint: Get their previous voting weight\n                    if (nCheckpoints != 0) prevTotalVotes = checkpoints[_from][nCheckpoints - 1].votes;\n\n                    // Update their voting weight\n                    _writeCheckpoint(_from, nCheckpoints, prevTotalVotes, prevTotalVotes - _amount);\n                }\n\n                // If this isn't a token burn:\n                if (_to != address(0)) { // @ audit here we add the votes to the target, but only if it's not zero address\n```\n\nThe owner might know that and can use such a delegation to interfere with the system by prohibiting of transferring/burning of his ids.\n\nThis happens via _afterTokenTransfer() reverting as it's becomes impossible to reduce owner's votes balance by `1`:\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L262-L271\n\n```solidity\n    function _afterTokenTransfer(\n        address _from,\n        address _to,\n        uint256 _tokenId\n    ) internal override {\n        // Transfer 1 vote from the sender to the recipient\n        _moveDelegateVotes(_from, _to, 1);\n\n        super._afterTokenTransfer(_from, _to, _tokenId);\n    }\n```\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider prohibiting zero address as a delegation destination:\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/lib/token/ERC721Votes.sol#L179-L190\n\n```solidity\n    function _delegate(address _from, address _to) internal {\n+\t\tif (_to == address(0)) revert INVALID_SIGNATURE();\n\n        // Get the previous delegate\n        address prevDelegate = delegation[_from];\n\n        // Store the new delegate\n        delegation[_from] = _to;\n\n        emit DelegateChanged(_from, prevDelegate, _to);\n\n        // Transfer voting weight from the previous delegate to the new delegate\n        _moveDelegateVotes(prevDelegate, _to, balanceOf(_from));\n    }\n```\n\nWhen `_to` isn't zero there always be an addition in _moveDelegateVotes(), so the system votes balance will be sustained.\n\n\n\n",
