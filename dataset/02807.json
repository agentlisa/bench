  "Content": "# Issue H-14: APWine PT redemptions can be blocked forever \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate-judging/issues/109 \n\n## Found by \nIllIllI\n\n## Summary\n\nAPWine PT redemptions can be blocked, causing Illuminate IPTs to be unredeemable\n\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nAPWine requires both a PT and a FYT to be provided in order to withdraw funds, and the `IRedeemer` may not be able to acquire the right number of both. The code assumes that FYTs will be available because the PT will have been rolled into the next period, generating new FYTs. However, the code does not account for malicious users sending extra PTs after the roll, to the `Lender`, which would mean there is no corresponding FYT available, and the redemption of all APWine PTs for that maturity/underlying combination will fail.\n\n\n## Impact\n\n_Permanent freezing of funds_\n\nUsers that provided their APWine PTs to mint Illuminate PTs (e.g. in order to be an LP in the pool) will have those tokens (their principal) locked forever. Because those users get Illuminate PTs, when it comes time to redeem a specific market, _ALL_ Illuminate PT holders of that market will receieve less than they lent, regardless of whether the original token was an underlying, or a non-APWine PT. The attacker can spend a single wei in order to perform the attack, and they can do so cheaply for every market that has APWine set, by buying one wei of PTs on the open market for each market before the roll, and sending the tokens after the roll.\n\nOne method to unblock things would be to buy the right FYTs on the open market, and send the right number back to the contract. However, a well-funded attacker could prevent this by buying up all available supply and have standing market orders for any new supply. One of the reasons for the Illuminate project is to concentrate liquidity since liquidity for these instruments is sparse, so cornering the market is well within the realm of possibility, and after the roll most other users not stuck in the contract will have redeemed their futures, so there will be little to no supply left, and the tokens will be stuck forever.\n\nWhile the Illuminate project does have an emergency `withdraw()` function that would allow an admin to rescue the funds and manually distribute them, this would not be trustless and defeats the purpose of having a smart contract.\n\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nThe `Redeemer` fetches the total `Lender` balance of PTs, and asks to redeem the whole amount (rolled amount + attacker ammount):\n```solidity\n// File: src/Redeemer.sol : Redeemer.redeem()   #1\n\n263            // Get the amount to be redeemed\n264 @>         uint256 amount = IERC20(principal).balanceOf(cachedLender);\n265    \n266            // Receive the principal token from the lender contract\n267            Safe.transferFrom(\n268                IERC20(principal),\n269                cachedLender,\n270                address(this),\n271                amount\n272            );\n...\n314            } else if (p == uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Apwine)) {\n315:@>             apwineWithdraw(principal, u, amount);\n```\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L263-L315\n\n\nInside `apwineWithdraw()`, `amount` from above becomes `a`, and that number is used in the call to `transferFYTs()`, which will fail due to the 'attacker amount' portion:\n```solidity\n// File: src/Redeemer.sol : Redeemer.apwineWithdraw()   #2\n\n551        function apwineWithdraw(\n552            address p,\n553            address u,\n554 @>         uint256 a\n555        ) internal {\n556            // Retrieve the vault which executes the redemption in APWine\n557            address futureVault = IAPWineToken(p).futureVault();\n558    \n559            // Retrieve the controller that will execute the withdrawal\n560            address controller = IAPWineFutureVault(futureVault)\n561                .getControllerAddress();\n562    \n563            // Retrieve the next period index\n564            uint256 index = IAPWineFutureVault(futureVault).getCurrentPeriodIndex();\n565    \n566            // Get the FYT address for the current period\n567            address fyt = IAPWineFutureVault(futureVault).getFYTofPeriod(index);\n568    \n569            // Trigger claim to FYTs by executing transfer\n570            // Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(fyt), address(lender), address(this), a);\n571 @>         ILender(lender).transferFYTs(fyt, a);\n572    \n573            // Redeem the underlying token from APWine to Illuminate\n574:           IAPWineController(controller).withdraw(futureVault, a);\n```\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L551-L574\n\n\nRedemptions of Illuminate PTs for underlyings is based on shares of each Illuminate PT's `totalSupply()` of the _available_ underlying, not the expect underlying total:\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L422\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L464\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L517\n\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nDo an explicit check for the number of FYTs received during the roll, and only transfer that amount. After the transfer, only `withdraw()` the minimum of `a` and the current FYT balance (to use up any FYTs manually transferred to the `Redeemer` if the attacker tries to undo what they did)\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**sourabhmarathe**\n\nAfter APWine rolls over to a new period, the Lender contract will be receive an equivalent amount of FYTs for each APWine PT it holds. As a result, we do not expect this to be an issue for APWine's redemption process.\n\n**IllIllI000**\n\n@sourabhmarathe the _Vulnerability Detail_ section mentions that the issue occurs when the attacker transfers new PTs _after_ the roll, so the Lender won't get FYTs for those new PTs\n\n**JTraversa**\n\nYup! Moved over to confirmed, and the suggested solution is pretty elegant! 👍 \n\n\n\n",
