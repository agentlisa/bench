Consider changing the solidity version pragma to the latest version (`pragma solidity ^0.4.11;`) to enforce latest compiler version to be used.\n\n\nAs an additional note, since the contracts are compiled with a recent version of Solidity, it’s possible to use the new [`transfer`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md#0410-2017-03-15) method instead of `send`([here](https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/17a5f8440a256a6dc5d8dd894b9615182c2901b2/contracts/BAToken.sol#L73), and [here](https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/blob/17a5f8440a256a6dc5d8dd894b9615182c2901b2/contracts/BAToken.sol#L87)).\n\n\n",

storage access.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * EVM: Support for the EVM Version \"Cancun\".\n * SMTChecker: Support `bytes.concat` except when string literals are passed as arguments.\n * SMTChecker: Print a message that function parameter name was used instead of a concrete value in a counterexample when the concrete value found by the solver is too long to print.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add experimental support to import EVM assembly in the format used by ``--asm-json``.\n * TypeChecker: Comparison of internal function pointers now yields a warning, as it can produce unexpected results with the legacy pipeline enabled.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * AST import: Fix bug when importing inline assembly with empty ``let`` variable declaration.\n\n\n### 0.8.23 (2023-11-08)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Optimizer: Fix block deduplicator bug which led to blocks which are identical apart from the contents of ``verbatim`` instructions to be treated as equivalent and thus collapsed into a single one.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: An empty ``--yul-optimizations`` sequence can now be always provided.\n * Standard JSON Interface: An empty ``optimizerSteps`` sequence can now always be provided.\n\n\n### 0.8.22 (2023-10-25)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Allow defining events at file level.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Code Generator: Remove redundant overflow checks of certain ``for`` loops when the counter variable cannot overflow.\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--no-import-callback`` option that prevents the compiler from loading source files not given explicitly on the CLI or in Standard JSON input.\n * Commandline Interface: Add an experimental ``--import-asm-json`` option that can import EVM assembly in the format used by ``--asm-json``.\n * Commandline Interface:

Optimizer: If ``PUSH0`` is supported, favor zero literals over storing zero values in variables.\n * Yul Optimizer: Run the ``Rematerializer`` and ``UnusedPruner`` steps at the end of the default clean-up sequence.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * AST: Fix wrong initial ID for Yul nodes in the AST.\n * Code Generator: Fix output from via-IR code generator being dependent on which files were discovered by import callback.

Reads and writes may now happen at any point at construction time outside of functions and modifiers. Explicit initialization is no longer mandatory.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ast-compact-json`` output in assembler mode.\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ir-ast-json`` and ``--ir-optimized-ast-json`` outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.\n * Commandline Interface: Respect ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` in compiler mode and accept them in assembler mode as well. ``--optimize --no-optimize-yul`` combination now allows enabling EVM assembly optimizer without enabling Yul optimizer.\n * EWasm: Remove EWasm backend.\n * Parser: Introduce ``pragma experimental solidity``, which will enable an experimental language mode that in particular has no stability guarantees between non-breaking releases and is not suited for production use.\n * SMTChecker: Add ``--model-checker-print-query`` CLI option and ``settings.modelChecker.printQuery`` JSON option to output the SMTChecker queries in the SMTLIB2 format. This requires using ``smtlib2`` solver only.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``ast`` file-level output for Yul input.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``irAst`` and ``irOptimizedAst`` contract-level outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.\n * Yul Optimizer: Remove experimental ``ReasoningBasedSimplifier`` optimization step.\n * Yul Optimizer: Stack-to-memory mover is now enabled by default whenever possible for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Code Generator: Disallow complex expressions whose results are types, built-ins, modules or some unassignable functions. The legacy code generation pipeline would not actually evaluate them, discarding any side-effects they might have.\n * Code Generator: Fix not entirely deterministic order of functions in unoptimized Yul output. The choice of C++ compiler in some cases would result in different (but equivalent) bytecode (especially from native binaries vs emscripten binaries).\n * Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using ``--stop-after parsing`` and requesting some of the outputs that require full analysis or compilation.\n * Commandline Interface: It is no longer possible to specify both ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` at the same time.\n * SMTChecker: Fix encoding of side-effects inside ``if`` and ``ternary conditional``statements in the BMC engine.\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negative when a verification target can be violated only by trusted external call from another public function.\n * SMTChecker: Fix generation of invalid SMT-LIB2 scripts in BMC engine with trusted mode for external calls when CHC engine times out.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by incorrectly classifying external function call using function pointer as a public getter.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by using external identifier to encode member access to functions that take an internal function as a parameter.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Fix an incomplete AST being returned when analysis is interrupted by certain kinds of fatal errors.\n * Type Checker: Disallow using certain unassignable function types in complex expressions.\n * Type Checker: Function declaration types referring to different declarations are no longer convertible to each other.\n * Yul Optimizer: Ensure that the assignment of memory slots for variables moved to memory does not depend on AST IDs that may depend on whether additional files are included during compilation.\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step not ignoring code that is not in expression-split form.\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix optimized IR being unnecessarily passed through the Yul optimizer again before bytecode generation.\n\n\nAST Changes:\n * AST: Add the ``experimentalSolidity`` field to the ``SourceUnit`` nodes, which indicate whether the experimental parsing mode has been enabled via ``pragma experimental solidity``.\n\n\n### 0.8.20 (2023-05-10)\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Assembler: Use ``push0`` for placing ``0`` on the stack for EVM versions starting from \"Shanghai\". This decreases the deployment and runtime costs.\n * EVM: Set default EVM version to \"Shanghai\".\n * EVM: Support for the EVM Version \"Shanghai\".\n * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``enum`` definitions.\n * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``struct`` definitions.\n * NatSpec: Include NatSpec from events that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it in userdoc and devdoc output.\n * Optimizer: Re-implement simplified version of ``UnusedAssignEliminator`` and ``UnusedStoreEliminator``. It can correctly remove some unused assignments in deeply nested loops that were ignored by the old version.\n * Parser: Unary plus is no longer recognized as a unary operator in the AST and triggers an error at the parsing stage (rather than later during the analysis).\n * SMTChecker: Add CLI option ``--model-checker-bmc-loop-iterations`` and a JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.bmcLoopIterations`` that specify how many loop iterations the BMC engine should unroll. Note that false negatives are possible when unrolling loops. This is due to the possibility that bmc loop iteration setting is less than actual number of iterations needed to complete a loop.\n * SMTChecker: Group all messages about unsupported language features in a single warning. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-unsupported`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showUnsupported`` can be enabled to show the full list.\n * SMTChecker: Properties that are proved safe are now reported explicitly at the end of analysis. By default, only the number of safe properties is shown. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-proved-safe`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showProvedSafe`` can be enabled to show the full list of safe properties.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add experimental support for importing ASTs via Standard JSON.\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: If available, use ``push0`` instead of ``codesize`` to produce an arbitrary value on stack in order to create equal stack heights between branches.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * ABI: Include events in the ABI that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it.\n * Immutables: Disallow initialization of immutables in try/catch statements.\n * SMTChecker: Fix false positives in ternary operators that contain verification targets in its branches, directly or indirectly.\n\n\nAST Changes:\n * AST: Add the ``internalFunctionIDs`` field to the AST nodes of contracts containing IDs of functions that may be called via the internal dispatch. The field is a map from function AST IDs to internal dispatch function IDs. These IDs are always generated, but they are only used in via-IR code generation.\n * AST: Add the ``usedEvents`` field to ``ContractDefinition`` which contains the AST IDs of all events emitted by the contract as well as all events defined and inherited by the contract.\n\n\n### 0.8.19 (2023-02-22)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Allow defining custom operators for user-defined value types via ``using {f as +} for T global`` syntax.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * SMTChecker: New trusted mode that assumes that any compile-time available code is the actual used code even in external calls. This can be used via the CLI option ``--model-checker-ext-calls trusted`` or the JSON field ``settings.modelChecker.extCalls: \"trusted\"``.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Assembler: Avoid duplicating subassembly bytecode where possible.\n * Code Generator: Avoid including references to the deployed label of referenced functions if they are called right away.\n * ContractLevelChecker: Properly distinguish the case of missing base constructor arguments from having an unimplemented base function.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by unhandled ``z3`` expressions that come from the solver when bitwise operators are used.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using the custom NatSpec annotation to abstract free functions.\n * TypeChecker: Also allow external library functions in ``using for``.\n\n\nAST Changes:\n * AST: Add ``function`` field to ``UnaryOperation`` and ``BinaryOperation`` AST nodes. ``functionList`` in ``UsingForDirective`` AST nodes will now contain ``operator`` and ``definition`` members instead of ``function`` when the list entry defines an operator.\n\n\n### 0.8.18 (2023-02-01)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Allow named parameters in mapping types.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--no-cbor-metadata`` that skips CBOR metadata from getting appended at the end of the bytecode.\n * Commandline Interface: Return exit code ``2`` on uncaught exceptions.\n * EVM: Deprecate ``block.difficulty`` and disallow ``difficulty()`` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= paris. The change is due to the renaming introduced by [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399).\n * EVM: Introduce ``block.prevrandao`` in Solidity and ``prevrandao()`` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= paris.\n * EVM: Set the default EVM version to \"Paris\".\n * EVM: Support for the EVM version \"Paris\".\n * Language Server: Add basic document hover support.\n * Natspec: Add event Natspec inheritance for devdoc.\n * Optimizer: Added optimization rule ``and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z)) => shl(X, and(Y, Z))``.\n * Parser: More detailed error messages about invalid version pragmas.\n * SMTChecker: Make ``z3`` the default solver for the BMC and CHC engines instead of all solvers.\n * SMTChecker: Support Eldarica as a Horn solver for the CHC engine when using the CLI option ``--model-checker-solvers eld``. The binary ``eld`` must be available in the system.\n * Solidity Upgrade Tool: Remove ``solidity-upgrade`` tool.\n * Standard JSON: Add a boolean field ``settings.metadata.appendCBOR`` that skips CBOR metadata from getting appended at the end of the bytecode.\n * TypeChecker: Warn when using deprecated builtin ``selfdestruct``.\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Generate more optimal code for user-defined functions that always terminate a transaction. No return labels will be pushed for calls to functions that always terminate.\n * Yul Optimizer: Allow replacing the previously hard-coded cleanup sequence by specifying custom steps after a colon delimiter (``:``) in the sequence string.\n * Yul Optimizer: Eliminate ``keccak256`` calls if the value was already calculated by a previous call and can be reused.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Parser: Disallow several ``indexed`` attributes for the same event parameter.\n * Parser: Disallow usage of the ``indexed`` attribute for modifier parameters.\n * SMTChecker: Fix display error for negative integers that are one more than powers of two.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on chain assignments using static fully specified state variables.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on multiple wrong SMTChecker natspec entries.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when a public library function is called internally.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when deleting struct member of function type.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using user-defined types as mapping indices or struct members.\n * SMTChecker: Improved readability for large integers that are powers of two or almost powers of two in error messages.\n * TypeChecker: Fix bug where private library functions could be attached with ``using for`` outside of their declaration scope.\n * Yul Optimizer: Hash hex and decimal literals according to their value instead of their representation, improving the detection of equivalent functions.\n\n\n### 0.8.17 (2022-09-08)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Yul Optimizer: Prevent the incorrect removal of storage writes before calls to Yul functions that conditionally terminate the external EVM call.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Code Generator: More efficient overflow checks for multiplication.\n * Language Server: Analyze all files in a project by default (can be customized by setting ``'file-load-strategy'`` to ``'directly-opened-and-on-import'`` in LSP settings object).\n * Yul Optimizer: Simplify the starting offset of zero-length operations to zero.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error on tuple assignments with invalid left-hand side.\n * Yul IR Code Generation: Fix internal compiler error when accessing the ``.slot`` member of a mapping through a storage reference in inline assembly.\n\n\nBuild System:\n * Allow disabling pedantic warnings and do not treat warnings as errors during compiler build when ``-DPEDANTIC=OFF`` flag is passed to CMake.\n * Update emscripten to version 3.1.19.\n\n\n### 0.8.16 (2022-08-08)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Code Generation: Fix data corruption that affected ABI-encoding of calldata values represented by tuples: structs at any nesting level; argument lists of external functions, events and errors; return value lists of external functions. The 32 leading bytes of the first dynamically-encoded value in the tuple would get zeroed when the last component contained a statically-encoded array.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Code Generator: More efficient code for checked addition and subtraction.\n * TypeChecker: Support using library constants in initializers of other constants.\n * Yul IR Code Generation: Improved copy routines for arrays with packed storage layout.\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to convert ``mod(add(X, Y), A)`` into ``addmod(X, Y, A)``, if ``A`` is a power of two.\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to convert ``mod(mul(X, Y), A)`` into ``mulmod(X, Y, A)``, if ``A`` is a power of two.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Commandline Interface: Disallow the following options outside of the compiler mode: ``--via-ir``,``--metadata-literal``, ``--metadata-hash``, ``--model-checker-show-unproved``, ``--model-checker-div-mod-no-slacks``, ``--model-checker-engine``, ``--model-checker-invariants``, ``--model-checker-solvers``, ``--model-checker-timeout``, ``--model-checker-contracts``, ``--model-checker-targets``.\n * Type Checker: Fix compiler crash on tuple assignments involving certain patterns with unary tuples on the left-hand side.\n * Type Checker: Fix compiler crash when ``abi.encodeCall`` received a tuple expression instead of an inline tuple.\n * Type Checker: Fix null dereference in ``abi.encodeCall`` type checking of free function.\n\n\n### 0.8.15 (2022-06-15)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Code Generation: Avoid writing dirty bytes to storage when copying ``bytes`` arrays.\n * Yul Optimizer: Keep all memory side-effects of inline assembly blocks.\n\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Add `E.selector` for a non-anonymous event `E` to access the 32-byte selector topic.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Language Server: Add rudimentary support for semantic highlighting.\n * Language Server: Adds support for configuring ``include-paths`` JSON settings object that can be passed during LSP configuration stage.\n * Language Server: Always add ``{project_root}/node_modules`` to include search paths.\n * Type Checker: Warn about assignments involving multiple pushes to storage ``bytes`` that may invalidate references.\n * Yul Optimizer: Improve inlining heuristics for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.\n\nBugfixes:\n * ABI Encoder: When encoding an empty string coming from storage do not add a superfluous empty slot for data.\n * Common Subexpression Eliminator: Process assembly items in chunks with maximum size of 2000.

This fixes potential mismatches between the constructor code of a contract compiled in isolation and the bytecode in ``type(C).creationCode``, resp. the bytecode used for ``new C(...)``.\n\n\n### 0.8.12 (2022-02-16)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * General: Add equality-comparison operators for external function types.\n * General: Support ``ContractName.functionName`` for ``abi.encodeCall``, in addition to external function pointers.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: Event and error signatures are also returned when using ``--hashes``.\n * Yul Optimizer: Remove ``mstore`` and ``sstore`` operations if the slot already contains the same value.\n * Yul: Emit immutable references for pure yul code when requested.\n\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Antlr Grammar: Allow builtin names in ``yulPath`` to support ``.address`` in function pointers.\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when accessing the members of external functions occupying more than two stack slots.\n * Code Generator: Fix internal error when doing an explicit conversion from ``string calldata`` to ``bytes``.\n * Control Flow Graph: Perform proper virtual lookup for modifiers for uninitialized variable and unreachable code analysis.\n * General: ``string.concat`` now properly takes strings as arguments and returns ``string memory``. It was accidentally introduced as a copy of ``bytes.concat`` before.\n * Immutables: Fix wrong error when the constructor of a base contract uses ``return`` and the derived contract contains immutable variables.\n * Inheritance: Consider functions in all ancestors during override analysis.\n * IR Generator: Add missing cleanup during the conversion of fixed bytes types to smaller fixed bytes types.\n * IR Generator: Add missing cleanup for indexed event arguments of value type.\n * IR Generator: Fix internal error when copying reference types in calldata and storage to struct or array members in memory.\n * IR Generator: Fix IR syntax error when copying storage arrays of structs containing functions.\n * Natspec: Fix internal error when overriding a struct getter with a Natspec-documented return value and the name in the struct is different.\n * Type Checker: Fix internal error when a constant variable declaration forward references a struct.\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Improved stack shuffling in corner cases.\n\n\nSolc-Js:\n * The wrapper now requires at least nodejs v10.\n * The code has been ported to TypeScript.\n\n\nBuild System:\n * Emscripten builds store the embedded WebAssembly binary in LZ4 compressed format and transparently decompress on loading.\n\n\n### 0.8.11 (2021-12-20)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * General: New builtin function ``abi.encodeCall(functionPointer, (arg1, arg2, ...))`` that type-checks the arguments and returns the ABI-encoded function call data.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--lsp`` option to get ``solc`` to act as a Language Server (LSP) communicating over stdio.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Code Generator: Fix a crash when using ``@use-src`` and compiling from Yul to ewasm.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when an unsafe target is solved more than once and the counterexample messages are different.\n * SMTChecker: Fix soundness of assigned storage/memory local pointers that were not erasing enough knowledge.\n * Fix internal error when a function has a calldata struct argument with an internal type inside.\n * IR Generator: Fix IR syntax error when copying storage arrays of functions.\n\n\n### 0.8.10 (2021-11-09)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Inline Assembly: Support ``.address`` and ``.selector`` on external function pointers to access their address and function selector.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Code Generator: Skip existence check for external contract if return data is expected. In this case, the ABI decoder will revert if the contract does not exist.\n * Commandline Interface: Accept nested brackets in step sequences passed to ``--yul-optimizations``.\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--debug-info`` option for selecting how much extra debug information should be included in the produced EVM assembly and Yul code.\n * Commandline Interface: Support ``--asm``, ``--bin``, ``--ir-optimized``, ``--ewasm`` and ``--ewasm-ir`` output selection options in assembler mode.\n * Commandline Interface: Use different colors when printing errors, warnings and infos.\n * JSON AST: Set absolute paths of imports earlier, in the ``parsing`` stage.\n * SMTChecker: Output values for ``block.*``, ``msg.*`` and ``tx.*`` variables that are present in the called functions.\n * SMTChecker: Report contract invariants and reentrancy properties. This can be enabled via the CLI option ``--model-checker-invariants`` or the Standard JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.invariants``.\n * Standard JSON: Accept nested brackets in step sequences passed to ``settings.optimizer.details.yulDetails.optimizerSteps``.\n * Standard JSON: Add ``settings.debug.debugInfo`` option for selecting how much extra debug information should be included in the produced EVM assembly and Yul code.\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Switch to new optimized code transform when compiling via Yul with enabled optimizer.\n * Yul Optimizer: Take control-flow side-effects of user-defined functions into account in various optimizer steps.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Code Generator: Fix constructor source mappings for immutables.\n * Commandline Interface: Disallow ``--error-recovery`` option outside of the compiler mode.\n * Commandline Interface: Don't return zero exit code when writing linked files to disk fails.\n * C"
