  "Content": "_Submitted by hyh, also found by rayn_\n\nFlywheelCore.setFlywheelRewards can remove current reward funds from the current users' reach as it doesn't check that newFlywheelRewards' FlywheelCore is this contract.\n\nIf it's not, by mistake or with a malicious intent, the users will lose the access to reward funds as this FlywheelCore will not be approved for any fund access to the new flywheelRewards, while all the reward funds be moved there.\n\nSetting severity to medium as on one hand that's system breaking issue (no rewards can be claimed after that, users are rugged reward-wise), on the other hand setFlywheelRewards function is requiresAuth. Also, a room for operational mistake isn't too small here as new flywheelRewards contract can be correctly configured and not malicious in all other regards.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nFlywheelCore.setFlywheelRewards doesn't check that newFlywheelRewards' FlywheelCore is this FlywheelCore instance:\n\n[FlywheelCore.sol#L164-L171](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/FlywheelCore.sol#L164-L171)<br>\n\nFlywheelCore is immutable within flywheelRewards and its access to the flywheelRewards' funds is set on construction:\n\n[BaseFlywheelRewards.sol#L30](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/rewards/BaseFlywheelRewards.sol#L30)<br>\n\nThis way if new flywheelRewards contract have any different FlywheelCore then current users' access to reward funds will be irrevocably lost as both claiming functionality and next run of setFlywheelRewards will revert, not being able to transfer any funds from flywheelRewards with `rewardToken.safeTransferFrom(address(flywheelRewards), ...)`:\n\n[FlywheelCore.sol#L125](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/FlywheelCore.sol#L125)<br>\n\n[FlywheelCore.sol#L168](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/FlywheelCore.sol#L168)<br>\n\nAs FlywheelCore holds user funds accounting via rewardsAccrued mapping, all these accounts became non-operational, as all the unclaimed rewards will be lost for the users.\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nConsider adding the require for `address(newFlywheelRewards.flywheel) == address(flywheelRewards.flywheel)` in setFlywheelRewards so that users always retain funds access.\n\n**[Joeysantoro (xTRIBE) acknowledged and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-xtribe-findings/issues/40#issuecomment-1110497641):**\n > Similar to [M-06](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-xtribe-findings/issues/23). I think adding this check makes sense.\n\n**[0xean (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-xtribe-findings/issues/40#issuecomment-1130776435):**\n > This issue seems distinct enough from M-06 to warrant separate issues.

User indexes track how far behind the strategy they are to lazily calculate all catch-up rewards.\n         * the accrued (unclaimed) rewards per user.\n         * references to the booster and rewards module described below.\n\n         Core does not manage any tokens directly.
