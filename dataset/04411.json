  "Content": "The [`burnOnRedeemInternal` function](https://gitlab.com/aave-tech/dlp/contracts/blob/1f8e5e65a99a887a5a13ad9af6486ebf93f57d02/contracts/tokenization/AToken.sol#L165) of the `AToken` contract emits a `BurnOnRedeem` event that logs the account and the number of tokens burned. However, this immediately follows a call to [OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 contract `_burn` function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.3.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L189) which [emits a `Transfer` event](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v2.3.0/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L194) with the same information.\n\n\nTo favor simplicity and avoid redundant operations, consider removing the `BurnOnRedeem` event.\n\n\n**Update**: *Fixed in [`bc43147`](https://gitlab.com/aave-tech/dlp/contracts/commit/bc4314719260425c95bc18664373e4da4fa6bc8e#a817c0eba461f5d46999a76647f0f6e7d4d6dc4e).*\n\n\n",

This means\n * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.\n * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.\n *\n * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply\n * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*\n *\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead\n * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional\n * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances.
