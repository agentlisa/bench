A flash loan can be initiated for any `receiverAddress`.\n\nThis is actually a known mistake that devs make and the aave docs warn about this (although admittedly the warning is not very clear):\nhttps://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/guides/flash-loans\n\n![2023-05-11_12-43](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo-roguereddwarf/assets/118631472/1bc59eb4-407b-4b5f-a38b-9c415932caf1)\n\nSo an attacker can execute a flash loan with the `MarginTrading` contract as `receiverAddress`. Also the funds that are needed to pay back the flash loan are pulled from the `receiverAddress` and NOT from the `initiator`:\n\nhttps://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/30a2a19f6d28b6fb8d26fc07568ca0f2918f4070/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L532-L536\n\nThis means the attacker can close a position or repay a position in the `MarginTrading` contract.\n\nBy crafting a malicious swap, the attacker can even steal funds.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\nLet's assume there is an ongoing trade in a `MarginTrading` contract:\n\n```text\ndaiAToken balance = 30000\nwethDebtToken balance = 10\n\nThe price of WETH when the trade was opened was ~ 3000 DAI\n```\n\nIn order to profit from this the attacker does the following (not considering fees for simplicity):\n1. Take a flash loan of 30000 DAI with `MarginTrading` as `receiverAddress` with `mode=0` (flash loan is paid back in the same transaction)\n2. Price of WETH has dropped to 2000 DAI. The attacker uses a malicious swap contract that pockets 10000 DAI for the attacker and swaps the remaining 20000 DAI to 10 WETH (the attacker can freely choose the swap contract in the `_params` of the flash loan).\n3. The 10 WETH debt is repaid\n4. Withdraw 30000 DAI from Aave to pay back the flash loan\n\n\n\n## Impact\nThe attacker can close trades, partially close trades and even steal funds.\n\n(Note: It's not possible for the attacker to open trades because he cannot incur debt on behalf of the `MarginTrading` contract)\n\n## Code Snippet\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-dodo/blob/main/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol#L121-L166\n\nhttps://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/30a2a19f6d28b6fb8d26fc07568ca0f2918f4070/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L481-L562\n\n## Tool used\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\nThe fix is straightforward:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol b/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol\nindex f68c1f3..5b4b485 100644\n--- a/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol\n+++ b/dodo-margin-trading-contracts/contracts/marginTrading/MarginTrading.sol\n@@ -125,6 +125,7 @@ contract MarginTrading is OwnableUpgradeable, IMarginTrading, IFlashLoanReceiver\n         address _initiator,\n         bytes calldata _params\n     ) external override onlyLendingPool returns (bool) {\n+        require(_initiator == address(this));\n         //decode params exe swap and deposit\n         {\n```\n\nThis ensures that the flash loan has been initiated by the `MarginTrading.executeFlashLoans` function which is the intended initiator.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**Zack995**\n\nI agree with the severity and error of this issue\n\n+        require(_initiator == address(this));\n         \nWe will adopt this recommendation to address the issue.\n\n**securitygrid**\n\nEscalate for 10 USDC\nI don't think the Vulnerability Detail of this report is correct. The key to this attack is the parameter. I wouldn't escalate it if it was a simple parameter. This is a complex parameter, especially when you want to steal the erc20 in MarginTrading or repay it and then steal the collateral. To repay for MarginTrading, the most important thing is: in the code of aave pool, msg.sender must be a borrower, that is, the MarginTrading contract itself. For detailed parameter encoding, see #69 and #74.\n\nThis escalatation is not intended to invalidate this issue. **The purposes are as follows**:\n1. A best report usually comes from a big name. But in fact it is not the best. Should non-best reports appear in the final report?\n2. I am thinking whether the report submitted in the future should be as simple as possible, which saves a lot of time. If a problem leads to an online attack specific to the protocol, I always describe its steps as clearly as possible in the report. However, it seems like this doesn't make sense.\n3. This is also a question that has been confusing everyone, and has not been answered. This is about multiple significant effects caused by the same code. Should separate reports be submitted or should different impacts be merged into one report? Some impacts cause DOS, some cause the core function logic to be destroyed, and the more serious one is the loss of funds.\n4. In the judge contest, many reports may be classified just by looking at the title (this is my guess). Because the number of submissions is huge, it will make the judge too tired. Is the judge's bonus too small?\n5. Are we doing security audit or functional audit?
