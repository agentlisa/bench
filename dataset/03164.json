  "Title": "No good way to disable routes in HubPool",
  "Content": "Within the `SpokePool` there exists the [`enabledDepositRoutes` mapping](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/bf03255cbd1db3045cd2fbf1580f24081f46b43a/contracts/SpokePool.sol#L58), which lists routes that have been approved for deposits (allowing a user to deposit in one spoke pool and withdraw the deposit from another). The [`setEnableRoute` function](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/bf03255cbd1db3045cd2fbf1580f24081f46b43a/contracts/SpokePool.sol#L212) can be used to enable or disable these routes.\n\n\nWithin the `HubPool`, there is a separate [`whitelistedRoutes` mapping](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/bf03255cbd1db3045cd2fbf1580f24081f46b43a/contracts/HubPool.sol#L78), which determines [whether tokens can be sent to a certain spoke during rebalances](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/bf03255cbd1db3045cd2fbf1580f24081f46b43a/contracts/HubPool.sol#L787). The only way to affect the `whitelistedRoutes` mapping is by calling [`whitelistRoute`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/bf03255cbd1db3045cd2fbf1580f24081f46b43a/contracts/HubPool.sol#L329-L343), which includes a call to [enable the `originToken`/`destinationChainId` pair](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/blob/bf03255cbd1db3045cd2fbf1580f24081f46b43a/contracts/HubPool.sol#L338-L341) within the Spoke. This means that there is no good way to disable a whitelisted route in the hub without “enabling” the same route in the `enabledDepositRoutes` mapping in the SpokePool.\n\n\nAssuming that there may be cases in the future where it would be desirable to disable a certain deposit route, consider adding a function which can disable a `whitelistedRoutes` element (by setting the value in the mapping to `address(0)`) without enabling the route in the SpokePool. It may be desirable to disable both atomically from the HubPool, or to establish a procedure to disable them independently in a specific order. Consider designing a procedure for valid cross-chain token transfers in the case that only one mapping has a certain route marked as “disabled”, and including this in the UMIP for dispute resolution. Finally, note that any “atomic” cancellations will still include a delay between when the message is initiated on the hub chain and when execution can be considered finalized on the spoke chain.\n\n\n**Update**: *Fixed in [pull request #89](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/pull/89) as of commit [`2d0adf78647070e4dd20690f67f46daaa6fc82c4`](https://github.com/across-protocol/contracts-v2/pull/89/commits/2d0adf78647070e4dd20690f67f46daaa6fc82c4).*\n\n\n",
