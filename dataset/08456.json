maturityRate : exchangeRate;\n\nThere are several places to modify for safety.\n\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L73>\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L104>\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L132>\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L176>\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L199>\n*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L231>\n\n**[JTraversa (Swivel) disputed, disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel-findings/issues/116#issuecomment-1185990904):**\n > I don't actually disagree with most of the warden's claims, just note that all of this would need to be intentional on the part of the user, and could not happen under any normal workflow of the protocol.\n> \n> E.g.:\n> > Alice splits 1000 USDC into zcToken and nToken using [splitUnderlying()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/Swivel/Swivel.sol#L578)\n> After the market is martured, she withdraws back 1000 USDC using [combineTokens()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/Swivel/Swivel.sol#L600)\n> \n> This interaction relies on a user calling `combineTokens` past maturity, which is 1. not possible from our UI 2. not beneficial in any way whatsoever, as redemption is explicitly done post maturity through `redeemZcToken`, + not using `redeemZcToken` would also fail to accrue post maturity interest.\n> \n> The same can be said of:\n> > Also, if she claims interest first before calling [combineTokens()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/Swivel/Swivel.sol#L600), she can't get paid back here 1000 USDC forever because [removeNotional()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L82) will revert [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-swivel/blob/fd36ce96b46943026cb2dfcb76dfa3f884f51c18/VaultTracker/VaultTracker.sol#L94) for the same reason.\n> \n> There is no use case to calling `combineTokens` after maturity, meaning this specifically isn't an issue in that direction either.\n> \n> Just disagreeing with severity because of the lack of potential impact in any reasonable operation of the protocol.
