  "Title": "[L01] Discarded return value",
  "Content": "The `makeCall` function of the `IdentityProxy` contract allows an authorized user to [make an arbitrary call](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/f64b4c5b5228ecbf41e3e7cfdbb8c0e9a983eea2/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/IdentityProxy.sol#L25) on behalf of the contract. However, the return value of the call is discarded, which unnecessarily limits the possible use cases. Consider bubbling the return value back to the caller so they can react to it.\n\n\n**Update:** *Fixed in commits [d417345](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/commit/d4173450bec550eec92c07a1e0dd0acb0720b32e) and [cba251c](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/commit/cba251cccd8495bbe6fb3a551714b2d895db6641).*\n\n\n",
