  "Content": "\nIn the [Arbitrum Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), there is no specification on how members are chosen in the event nominees are tied for votes.\n\nCurrently, `selectTopNominees()` simply picks the first 6 nominees after `LibSort.insertionSort()` is called, which means the nominee selected is random in the event they tie:\n\n[SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L203-L217](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5/src/security-council-mgmt/governors/modules/SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernorCountingUpgradeable.sol#L203-L217)\n\n```solidity\n        uint256[] memory topNomineesPacked = new uint256[](k);\n\n        for (uint16 i = 0; i < nominees.length; i++) {\n            uint256 packed = (uint256(weights[i]) << 16) | i;\n\n            if (topNomineesPacked[0] < packed) {\n                topNomineesPacked[0] = packed;\n                LibSort.insertionSort(topNomineesPacked);\n            }\n        }\n\n        address[] memory topNomineesAddresses = new address[](k);\n        for (uint16 i = 0; i < k; i++) {\n            topNomineesAddresses[i] = nominees[uint16(topNomineesPacked[i])];\n        }\n```\n\nThis could be confusing for users who expect tiebreaks to be handled in a deterministic manner (eg. whoever got the number of votes first).\n\n### Recommendation\n\nConsider documenting how voting ties are handled in the [Arbitrum Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) to prevent confusion.\n\n",
