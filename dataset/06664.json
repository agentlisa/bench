  "Title": "[H-02] It is impossible to slash queued withdrawals that contain a malicious strategy due to a misplacement of the ++i increment",
  "Content": "\n`StrategyManager::slashQueuedWithdrawal()` contains an `indicesToSkip` parameter to skip malicious strategies, as documented in the [function definition](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/main/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L532-L534):\n\n> so that, e.g., if the slashed `QueuedWithdrawal` contains a malicious strategy in the `strategies` array which always reverts on calls to its 'withdraw' function, then the malicious strategy can be skipped (with the shares in effect \"burned\"), while the non-malicious strategies are still called as normal.\n\nThe problem is, the function does not work as expected, and `indicesToSkip` is ignored. If the queued withdrawal contains a malicious strategy, it will make the slash always revert.\n\nOwners won't be able to slash queued withdrawals that contain a malicious strategy.\n\nAn adversary can take advantage of this and create withdrawal queues that won't be able to be slashed, completely defeating the slash system. The adversary can later complete the withdrawal.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nThe `++i;` statement in `StrategyManager::slashQueuedWithdrawal()` is misplaced. It is only executed on the `else` statement:\n\n```solidity\n    // keeps track of the index in the `indicesToSkip` array\n    uint256 indicesToSkipIndex = 0;\n\n    uint256 strategiesLength = queuedWithdrawal.strategies.length;\n    for (uint256 i = 0; i < strategiesLength;) {\n        // check if the index i matches one of the indices specified in the `indicesToSkip` array\n        if (indicesToSkipIndex < indicesToSkip.length && indicesToSkip[indicesToSkipIndex] == i) {\n            unchecked {\n                ++indicesToSkipIndex;\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (queuedWithdrawal.strategies[i] == beaconChainETHStrategy){\n                    //withdraw the beaconChainETH to the recipient\n                _withdrawBeaconChainETH(queuedWithdrawal.depositor, recipient, queuedWithdrawal.shares[i]);\n            } else {\n                // tell the strategy to send the appropriate amount of funds to the recipient\n                queuedWithdrawal.strategies[i].withdraw(recipient, tokens[i], queuedWithdrawal.shares[i]);\n            }\n            unchecked {\n                ++i; // @audit\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n[Link to code](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/main/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L556-L579)\n\nLet's suppose that the owner tries to slash a queued withdrawal, and wants to skip the first strategy (index `0`) because it is malicious and makes the whole transaction revert.\n\n1 . It defines `indicesToSkipIndex = 0`.<br>\n2 . It enters the `for` loop starting at `i = 0`.<br>\n3 . `if (indicesToSkipIndex < indicesToSkip.length && indicesToSkip[indicesToSkipIndex] == i)` will be true: `0 < 1 && 0 == 0`.<br>\n4 . It increments `++indicesToSkipIndex;` to \"skip\" the malicious strategy, so now `indicesToSkipIndex = 1`.<br>\n5 . It goes back to the `for` loop. But `i` hasn't been modified, so still `i = 0`.<br>\n6 . `if (indicesToSkipIndex < indicesToSkip.length && indicesToSkip[indicesToSkipIndex] == i)` will be false now: `1 < 1 && 0 == 0`.<br>\n7 . It will enter the `else` statement and attempt to slash the strategy anyway.<br>\n8 . If the strategy is malicious, it will revert, making it impossible to slash.<br>\n9 . The adversary can later complete the withdrawal.<br>\n\n### POC Test\n\nThis test shows how the `indicesToSkip` parameter is completely ignored.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity of the test, it uses a normal strategy; which will be slashed, proving that it ignores the `indicesToSkip` parameter and it indeed calls `queuedWithdrawal.strategies[i].withdraw()`.\n\nA malicious strategy that makes `withdraw()` revert, would be to make the whole transaction revert (not shown on this test but easily checkable as the [function won't catch it](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer/blob/main/src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol#L536-L579)).\n\nAdd this test to `src/tests/StrategyManagerUnit.t.sol` and run `forge test -m \"testSlashQueuedWithdrawal_IgnoresIndicesToSkip\"`.\n\n```solidity\n    function testSlashQueuedWithdrawal_IgnoresIndicesToSkip() external {\n        address recipient = address(this);\n        uint256 depositAmount = 1e18;\n        uint256 withdrawalAmount = depositAmount;\n        bool undelegateIfPossible = false;\n\n        // Deposit into strategy and queue a withdrawal\n        (IStrategyManager.QueuedWithdrawal memory queuedWithdrawal,,) =\n            testQueueWithdrawal_ToSelf_NotBeaconChainETH(depositAmount, withdrawalAmount, undelegateIfPossible);\n\n        // Slash the delegatedOperator\n        slasherMock.freezeOperator(queuedWithdrawal.delegatedAddress);\n\n        // Keep track of the balance before the slash attempt\n        uint256 balanceBefore = dummyToken.balanceOf(address(recipient));\n\n        // Assert that the strategies array only has one element\n        assertEq(queuedWithdrawal.strategies.length, 1);\n\n        // Set `indicesToSkip` so that it should ignore the only strategy\n        // As it's the only element, its index is `0`\n        uint256[] memory indicesToSkip = new uint256[](1);\n        indicesToSkip[0] = 0;\n\n        // Call `slashQueuedWithdrawal()`\n        // This should not try to slash the only strategy the queue has, because of the defined `indicesToSkip`\n        // But in fact it ignores `indicesToSkip` and attempts to do it anyway\n        cheats.startPrank(strategyManager.owner());\n        strategyManager.slashQueuedWithdrawal(recipient, queuedWithdrawal, _arrayWithJustDummyToken(), indicesToSkip);\n        cheats.stopPrank();\n\n        uint256 balanceAfter = dummyToken.balanceOf(address(recipient));\n\n        // The `indicesToSkip` was completely ignored, and the function attempted the slash anyway\n        // It can be asserted due to the fact that it increased the balance\n        require(balanceAfter == balanceBefore + withdrawalAmount, \"balanceAfter != balanceBefore + withdrawalAmount\");\n    }\n```\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nPlace the `++i` outside of the if/else statement. This way, it will increment each time the loop runs.\n\n```diff\n    for (uint256 i = 0; i < strategiesLength;) {\n        // check if the index i matches one of the indices specified in the `indicesToSkip` array\n        if (indicesToSkipIndex < indicesToSkip.length && indicesToSkip[indicesToSkipIndex] == i) {\n            unchecked {\n                ++indicesToSkipIndex;\n            }\n        } else {\n            if (queuedWithdrawal.strategies[i] == beaconChainETHStrategy){\n                    //withdraw the beaconChainETH to the recipient\n                _withdrawBeaconChainETH(queuedWithdrawal.depositor, recipient, queuedWithdrawal.shares[i]);\n            } else {\n                // tell the strategy to send the appropriate amount of funds to the recipient\n                queuedWithdrawal.strategies[i].withdraw(recipient, tokens[i], queuedWithdrawal.shares[i]);\n            }\n-           unchecked {\n-               ++i;\n-           }\n        }\n+       unchecked {\n+           ++i;\n+       }\n    }\n```\n### Assessed type\n\nLoop\n\n**[sorrynotsorry (lookout) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer-findings/issues/205#issuecomment-1537495164):**\n > The issue is well demonstrated, properly formatted, and contains a coded POC.\n> Marking as HQ.\n\n**[Sidu28 (EigenLayer) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer-findings/issues/205#issuecomment-1544938170)**\n\n\n**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-eigenlayer-findings/issues/205#issuecomment-1572116117):**\n > The Warden has shown how, due to incorrect placement of the loop increment, malicious strategies cannot be skipped when slashing queued withdrawals.\n> \n> Because this breaks a core functionality of the contracts, which will also cause a loss of funds, I agree with High Severity.\n> \n> Mitigation is straightforward.\n\n***\n\n",
