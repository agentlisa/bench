I missed the escalation period but still want to make a comment - should this therotically be medium instead of high, since it won't cause a direct loss of funds or non-material losses?\n\n**amankakar**\n\n> Nice issue. I missed the escalation period but still want to make a comment - should this therotically be medium instead of high, since it won't cause a direct loss of funds or non-material losses?\n\nAlthough i have missed this finding But I think the High is appropriate because the user can easily bypass the blacklist status.\n\n**blutorque**\n\nI think this is more severe, considering the mTBill can immediately be traded in a secondary market(such as Morpho), which already hold ~[30%](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xDD629E5241CbC5919847783e6C96B2De4754e438) of mTBill supply.\n\n",
