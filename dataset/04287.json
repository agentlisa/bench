  "Title": "[L07] Transfer of ETH may unexpectedly fail",
  "Content": "In the [`_withdraw`](https://github.com/mcdexio/mai-protocol-v2/blob/4b198083ec4ae2d6851e101fc44ea333eaa3cd92/contracts/perpetual/Collateral.sol#L84) and [`withdrawFromProtocol`](https://github.com/mcdexio/mai-protocol-v2/blob/4b198083ec4ae2d6851e101fc44ea333eaa3cd92/contracts/perpetual/Collateral.sol#L114) functions of the `Collateral` contract, the transfer of Ether is executed with Solidity’s `transfer` function, which forwards a limited amount of gas to the receiver. Should the receiver be a contract with a fallback function that needs more than 2300 units of gas to execute, the transfer of Ether would inevitably fail. After the Istanbul hard fork, it has become a [recommended practice not to use `transfer`](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/) to avoid hard dependencies on specific gas costs.\n\n\nTo avoid unexpected failures in the withdrawal of Ether, consider replacing `transfer` with the [`sendValue` function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.0.0/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L51) available in the OpenZeppelin Contracts library.\n\n\n**Update:** *Fixed. The `transfer` function has been replaced with the `sendValue` function.*\n\n\n",
