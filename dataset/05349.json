  "Title": "[M-02] Decimals of LendingPool don't take into account the offset introduced by VIRTUAL\\_SHARES",
  "Content": "\nThe impact of this finding is more on the marketing/data fetching side, on exchanges it would appear that the shares are worth less `VIRTUAL_SHARES` than the underlying token. Given that it would influence the perception of the value of the shares token, medium severity seems appropriate.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nThe Openzeppelin [implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L106-L108) includes the decimals offset (log10(`VIRTUAL_SHARES`) in LendingPool) in the `decimals()` function. However, INIT only places the decimals of the [underlying](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-initcapital/blob/main/contracts/lending_pool/LendingPool.sol#L95-L97).\n\nA POC was built, add it to `TestLendingPool.sol`:\n\n```solidity\nfunction test_POC_WrongDecimals() public {\n    uint256 _wbtcAmount = 3e8; // 3 BTC\n    address _user = makeAddr(\"user\");\n    _mintPool(_user, WBTC, _wbtcAmount);\n    uint256 _wbtcDecimals = 1e8;\n    uint256 VIRTUAL_SHARES = 1e8;\n    uint256 _poolDecimals = 10**lendingPools[WBTC].decimals();\n    uint256 _userBalance = lendingPools[WBTC].balanceOf(_user);\n    assertEq(_userBalance/_poolDecimals, _wbtcAmount/_wbtcDecimals*VIRTUAL_SHARES);\n    assertEq(_userBalance/_poolDecimals, 3e8);\n    assertEq(_userBalance, _wbtcAmount*VIRTUAL_SHARES);\n}\n```\n\n### Tools Used\n\nVscode, Foundry\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nInclude the virtual shares decimals in the `decimals()` function:\n\n```solidity\nuint private constant VIRTUAL_SHARES = 8;\n...\nfunction decimals() public view override returns (uint8) {\n    return IERC20Metadata(underlyingToken).decimals() + VIRTUAL_SHARES;\n}\n...\nfunction _toShares(uint _amt, uint _totalAssets, uint _totalShares) internal pure returns (uint shares) {\n    return _amt.mulDiv(_totalShares + 10**VIRTUAL_SHARES, _totalAssets + VIRTUAL_ASSETS);\n}\n...\nfunction _toAmt(uint _shares, uint _totalAssets, uint _totalShares) internal pure returns (uint amt) {\n    return _shares.mulDiv(_totalAssets + VIRTUAL_ASSETS, _totalShares + 10**VIRTUAL_SHARES);\n}\n```\n\n**[fez-init (INIT) confirmed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-initcapital-findings/issues/36#issuecomment-1870338593)**\n\n\n***\n\n",

This contract extends\n * the ERC-20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \"shares\" token represented by this\n * contract and not the \"assets\" token which is an independent contract.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\n * with a \"donation\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation\n * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial\n * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may\n * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by\n * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as\n * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\n *\n * Since v4.9, this implementation introduces configurable virtual assets and shares to help developers mitigate that risk.\n * The `_decimalsOffset()` corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals\n * and the vault decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which\n * itself determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default\n * offset (0) makes it non-profitable even if an attacker is able to capture value from multiple user deposits, as a result\n * of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's donation) matching the attacker's expected gains.\n * With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more expensive than it is profitable. More details about the\n * underlying math can be found xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].\n *\n * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued\n * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets\n * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience\n * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the\n * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.\n *\n * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract ERC4626 is ERC20, IERC4626 {\n    using Math for uint256;\n\n    IERC20 private immutable _asset;\n    uint8 private immutable _underlyingDecimals;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to deposit more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to mint more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxMint(address receiver, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to withdraw more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(address owner, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to redeem more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(address owner, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Set the underlying asset contract.
