[This line](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/c7a20e56a0a6659c09314a877b440198eff0cd81/protocol/contracts/libraries/Silo/LibTokenSilo.sol#L218) in the `LibTokenSilo::removeDepositFromAccount` NatSpec appears to refer to the legacy deposits mapping and should be updated to the new [Silo v3 deposits](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/c7a20e56a0a6659c09314a877b440198eff0cd81/protocol/contracts/beanstalk/AppStorage.sol#L156) stored as a mapping `uint256` to `Deposit`. If this comment already intends to refer to the new deposits mapping, it should be made clear that `[token][stem]` is meant to indicate the concatenation of the token address and stem value to get the deposit identifier used as a key to the mapping.",
