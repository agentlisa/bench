  "Content": "\n### Links\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.9/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L158-L163<br>\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-ai-arena/blob/main/src/Neuron.sol#L143\n\n### Description\n\nSee the OZ `transferFrom()` implementation:\n```solidity\n    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {\n        address spender = _msgSender();\n        _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);\n        _transfer(from, to, amount);\n        return true;\n    }\n```\n`Neuron.claim()` can run the above code directly without spending extra gas for the function call and to cache `msg.sender`.\n\n### Recommended Fix\n\n```diff\n    function claim(uint256 amount) external {\n        require(\n            allowance(treasuryAddress, msg.sender) >= amount, \n            \"ERC20: claim amount exceeds allowance\"\n        );\n-       transferFrom(treasuryAddress, msg.sender, amount);\n+       _spendAllowance(treasuryAddress, msg.sender, amount);\n+       _transfer(treasuryAddress, msg.sender, amount);\n        emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, amount);\n    }\n```\n\n",

To change this, you should override\n * this function so it returns a different value.\n *\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless\n * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20\n * applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances.
