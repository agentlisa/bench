  "Content": "# Issue M-8: The claimable rewards amount for borrowers decreases over time \n\nSource: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model-judging/issues/98 \n\nThe protocol has acknowledged this issue.\n\n## Found by \nTrumpero, ether\\_sky\n## Summary\nThe `RewardsController` handles the distribution of `rewards` for both `borrowers` and `depositors`.\nOnce `rewards` are assigned to users, they should not be changed, as is typical in most `rewards distribution system`.\nHowever, the actual `rewards` amounts that users can `claim` will vary depending on when they choose to `claim` them.\nIn other words, the `claimable rewards amount` decreases over time.\n## Vulnerability Detail\nThere are two types of `borrow shares`: `floating borrow shares` and `fixed borrow shares`.\nWhen calculating the `claimable rewards` for `borrowers`, we compute the `fixed borrow shares`.\n```solidity\nfunction claim(\n  MarketOperation[] memory marketOps,\n  address to,\n  ERC20[] memory rewardsList\n) public claimSender returns (ERC20[] memory, uint256[] memory claimedAmounts) {\n  uint256 rewardsCount = rewardsList.length;\n  claimedAmounts = new uint256[](rewardsCount);\n  address sender = _claimSender;\n  for (uint256 i = 0; i < marketOps.length; ) {\n    MarketOperation memory marketOperation = marketOps[i];\n    Distribution storage dist = distribution[marketOperation.market];\n    uint256 availableRewards = dist.availableRewardsCount;\n    for (uint128 r = 0; r < availableRewards; ) {\n      update(\n        sender,\n        marketOperation.market,\n        dist.availableRewards[r],\n        accountBalanceOperations(  // @audit, here\n          marketOperation.market,\n          marketOperation.operations,\n          sender,\n          dist.rewards[dist.availableRewards[r]].start\n        )\n      );\n      unchecked {\n        ++r;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThe calculation for `fixed borrow shares` depends on the current `floating debt amount`.\n```solidity\nfunction accountFixedBorrowShares(\n  Market market,\n  address account,\n  uint32 start\n) internal view returns (uint256 fixedDebt) {\n  uint256 firstMaturity = start - (start % FixedLib.INTERVAL) + FixedLib.INTERVAL;\n  uint256 maxMaturity = block.timestamp -\n    (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL) +\n    (FixedLib.INTERVAL * market.maxFuturePools());\n\n  for (uint256 maturity = firstMaturity; maturity <= maxMaturity; ) {\n    (uint256 principal, ) = market.fixedBorrowPositions(maturity, account);\n    fixedDebt += principal;\n    unchecked {\n      maturity += FixedLib.INTERVAL;\n    }\n  }\n  fixedDebt = market.previewRepay(fixedDebt);  // @audit, here\n}\n```\nSince the `floating debt` increases overtime, the `fixed borrow shares` decreases accordingly.\n```solidity\nfunction previewBorrow(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256) {\n  uint256 supply = totalFloatingBorrowShares; // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalFloatingBorrowShares is non-zero.\n\n  return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivUp(supply, totalFloatingBorrowAssets());  // @audit, here\n}\n\nfunction totalFloatingBorrowAssets() public view returns (uint256) {\n  uint256 memFloatingDebt = floatingDebt;\n  uint256 memFloatingAssets = floatingAssets;\n  uint256 newDebt = memFloatingDebt.mulWadDown(\n    interestRateModel\n      .floatingRate(\n        floatingUtilization(memFloatingAssets, memFloatingDebt),\n        globalUtilization(memFloatingAssets, memFloatingDebt, floatingBackupBorrowed)\n      )\n      .mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastFloatingDebtUpdate, 365 days)\n  );\n  return memFloatingDebt + newDebt; // @audit, here\n}\n```\nConsequently, the `claimable rewards amount` also decreases over time.\n\nLet's consider an example.\nTwo `borrowers`, `BOB` and `ALICE`, `borrow` funds at a `maturity` of `4 weeks`.\nAfter `1 week`, the `claimable rewards amount` for both `borrowers` is obviously the same.\n`BOB` updates his `rewards index` every day.( for testing purpose, simulate this using the `handleBorrow` function with `0` balance change in the test)\nAfter `12 weeks`, the `claimable rewards amount` for both `borrowers` are different.\nThe `rewards` for `BOB` are larger than those for `ALICE`.\nThis illustrates that if a user misses updating their `rewards index`, the `claimable rewards amount` decreases.\nPlease check below log.\n```solidity\nClamaible after 1 weeks for ALICE    =>  17492241039103089964\nClamaible after 1 weeks for BOB      =>  17492241039103089964\n*****************\nClamaible after 12 weeks for ALICE   =>  208531472281735404397\nClamaible after 12 weeks for BOB     =>  209300027311073978764\n```\n\nPlease add below test to `RewardsController.t.sol`.\n```solidity\nfunction testRewardBalanceCheck() external {\n  vm.prank(ALICE);\n  marketUSDC.approve(address(this), 100 ether);\n\n  vm.prank(BOB);\n  marketUSDC.approve(address(this), 100 ether);\n\n  vm.prank(ALICE);\n  auditor.enterMarket(marketUSDC);\n\n  vm.prank(BOB);\n  auditor.enterMarket(marketUSDC);\n\n  marketUSDC.deposit(30 ether, ALICE);\n  marketUSDC.deposit(30 ether, BOB);\n\n  marketUSDC.borrowAtMaturity(4 weeks, 1 ether, 20 ether, ALICE, ALICE);\n  marketUSDC.borrowAtMaturity(4 weeks, 1 ether, 20 ether, BOB, BOB);\n\n  marketUSDC.deposit(40 ether, address(this));\n  marketUSDC.borrow(20 ether, address(this), address(this));\n  vm.warp(1 weeks);\n  console2.log(\"Clamaible after 1 weeks for ALICE    => \", rewardsController.allClaimable(ALICE, opRewardAsset));\n  console2.log(\"Clamaible after 1 weeks for BOB      => \", rewardsController.allClaimable(BOB, opRewardAsset));\n\n  for (uint256 i = 1; i < 12 * 7; i ++) {\n    vm.warp(i * 1 days);\n    vm.prank(address(marketUSDC));\n    rewardsController.handleBorrow(BOB);\n  }\n\n\n  vm.warp(12 weeks);\n  console2.log(\"*****************\");\n  console2.log(\"Clamaible after 12 weeks for ALICE   => \", rewardsController.allClaimable(ALICE, opRewardAsset));\n  console2.log(\"Clamaible after 12 weeks for BOB     => \", rewardsController.allClaimable(BOB, opRewardAsset));\n}\n```\n## Impact\nWhenever a `borrower` changes the `balance`, the `rewards index` is updated.\nAt that moment, the `total fixed borrow shares` is the sum of `individual fixed borrow shares`, and the current available `rewards` are divided by this `total fixed borrow shares`.\nHowever, when other `borrowers` claim their `rewards` later on, their `fixed borrow shares` are less than they were at the time of `update`.\nThis reduction in `fixed borrow shares` leads to a decrease in the actual `claimed rewards`.\n## Code Snippet\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/RewardsController.sol#L116-L121\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/RewardsController.sol#L379\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L954-L958\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-interest-rate-model/blob/8f6ef1b0868d3ea3a98a5ab7e8b3a164857681d7/protocol/contracts/Market.sol#L919\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\nWe can take a snapshot of the `fixed borrow shares` when `fixed borrowing` occurs.\n\n",
