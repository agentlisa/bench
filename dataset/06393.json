  "Content": "\nIn case Distributor.setDistribution use, revenue from rToken RevenueTrader and rsr token RevenueTrader should be distributed. Otherwise wrong distribution will be used.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n`BackingManager.forwardRevenue` function sends revenue amount to the `rsrTrader` and `rTokenTrader` contracts, [according to the distribution inside `Distributor` contract](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/c4ec2473bbcb4831d62af55d275368e73e16b984/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L236-L249). For example it can `50%`/`50%`. In case if we have 2 destinations in Distributor: strsr and furnace, that means that half of revenue will be received by strsr stakers as rewards.\n\nThis distribution [can be changed](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/c4ec2473bbcb4831d62af55d275368e73e16b984/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol#L61-L65) at any time.<br>\nThe job of `RevenueTrader` is to sell provided token for a `tokenToBuy` and then distribute it using `Distributor.distribute` function. There are 2 ways of auction that are used: dutch and gnosis. Dutch auction will call `RevenueTrader.settleTrade`, which [will initiate distribution](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/c4ec2473bbcb4831d62af55d275368e73e16b984/contracts/p1/RevenueTrader.sol#L50). But Gnosis trade will not do that and user should call `distributeTokenToBuy` manually, after auction is settled.\n\nThe problem that I want to discuss is next.<br>\nSuppose, that governance at the beginning set distribution as 50/50 between 2 destinations: strsr and furnace. And then later `forwardRevenue` sent some tokens to the rsrTrader and rTokenTrader. Then, when trade was active to exchange some token to rsr token, `Distributor.setDistribution` was set in order to make strsr share to 0, so now everything goes to Furnace only. As result, when trade will be finished in the rsrTrader and `Distributor.distribute` will be called, then those tokens will not be sent to the strsr contract, because their share is 0 now.\nThey will be stuck inside rsrTrader.\n\nAnother problem here is that strsr holders should receive all revenue from the time, where they distribution were created. What i mean is if in time 0, rsr share was 50% and in time 10 rsr share is 10%, then `BackingManager.forwardRevenue` should be called for all tokens that has surplus, because if that will be done after changing to 10%, then strsr stakers will receive less revenue.\n\n### Tools Used\n\nVsCode\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\nYou need to think how to guarantee fair distribution to the strsr stakers, when distribution params are changed.\n\n**[tbrent (Reserve) confirmed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-reserve-findings/issues/34#issuecomment-1620796074):**\n > This is a good find. The mitigation we have in mind is adding a new function to the `RevenueTrader` that allows anyone to transfer a registered ERC20 back to the `BackingManager`, as long as the current distribution for that `tokenToBuy` is 0%. \n\n**[Reserve mitigated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-reserve-mitigation#individual-prs):**\n> Distribute revenue in `setDistribution`.<br>\n> PR: https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/878\n\n**Status:** Mitigation error.
