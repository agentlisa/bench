Liquidators will not be incentivized to liquidate such accounts, which may lead to liquidation being delayed or not performed, exposing Party B to unnecessary risks and potentially resulting in greater asset losses than anticipated.\n\n## Vulnerability Detail\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L269\n\n```solidity\nFile: LiquidationFacetImpl.sol\n240:     function liquidatePartyB(\n..SNIP..\n259:         if (uint256(-availableBalance) < accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].lf) {\n260:             remainingLf =\n261:                 accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].lf -\n262:                 uint256(-availableBalance);\n263:             liquidatorShare = (remainingLf * maLayout.liquidatorShare) / 1e18;\n264: \n265:             maLayout.partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare[partyB][partyA] =\n266:                 (remainingLf - liquidatorShare) /\n267:                 quoteLayout.partyBPositionsCount[partyB][partyA];\n268:         } else {\n269:             maLayout.partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare[partyB][partyA] = 0;\n270:         }\n```\n\nAssume that the loss of Party B is more than the liquidation fee. In this case, the else branch of the above code within the `liquidatePartyB` function will be executed. The `liquidatorShare` and `partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare` variables will both be zero, which means the liquidators will get nothing in return for liquidating PartyBs\n\nAs a result, there will not be any incentive for the liquidators to liquidate such positions.\n\n## Impact\n\nLiquidators will not be incentivized to liquidate those accounts that do not provide them with a liquidation fee. As a result, the liquidation of those accounts might be delayed or not performed at all. When liquidation is not performed in a timely manner, PartyB ended up taking on additional unnecessary risks that could be avoided in the first place if a different liquidation incentive mechanism is adopted, potentially leading to PartyB losing more assets than expected.\n\nAlthough PartyBs are incentivized to perform liquidation themselves since it is the PartyBs that take on the most risks from the late liquidation, the roles of PartyB and liquidator are clearly segregated in the protocol design. Only addresses granted the role of liquidators can perform liquidation as the liquidation functions are guarded by `onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)`. Unless the contracts are implemented in a manner that automatically grants a liquidator role to all new PartyB upon registration OR liquidation functions are made permissionless, PartyBs are likely not able to perform the liquidation themselves when the need arises.\n\nMoreover, the PartyBs are not expected to be both a hedger and liquidator simultaneously as they might not have the skillset or resources to maintain an infrastructure for monitoring their accounts/positions for potential late liquidation.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nhttps://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L269\n\n## Tool used\n\nManual Review\n\n## Recommendation\n\nConsidering updating the liquidation incentive mechanism that will always provide some incentive for the liquidators to take the initiative to liquidate insolvent accounts. This will help to build a more robust and efficient liquidation mechanism for the protocols. One possible approach is to always give a percentage of the CVA of the liquidated account as a liquidation fee to the liquidators.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n**MoonKnightDev**\n\nIf we encounter a late liquidation, our incentives are as follows:\n\nIf Party B or Party A, which is linked with only one counterparty, undergoes liquidation, and there is an isolated environment between the two, and in any case, all the funds transfer from one side to the other, so the liquidation time is not important anymore. And in a way, late liquidation is meaningless here.\n\nHence, one of the parties or any interested party can call this. If the individual being liquidated is connected with multiple counterparties, the remaining counterparties would call this liquidation to prevent further losses.\n\nThese can be called for when it is not beneficial for the liquidator.\n\nBut in general, we plan to always have incentives for liquidators\n\n**hrishibhat**\n\n@xiaoming9090 \n\n**xiaoming9090**\n\n> If we encounter a late liquidation, our incentives are as follows:\n> \n> If Party B or Party A, which is linked with only one counterparty, undergoes liquidation, and there is an isolated environment between the two, and in any case, all the funds transfer from one side to the other, so the liquidation time is not important anymore.

This seems reasonable on design, however, the implementation of current system does not allow the counterparty to do so.\n\nAs mentioned in my report and other Watson reports (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical-judging/issues/296), \n\n>Although PartyBs are incentivized to perform liquidation themselves since it is the PartyBs that take on the most risks from the late liquidation, the roles of PartyB and liquidator are clearly segregated in the protocol design. Only addresses granted the role of liquidators can perform liquidation as the liquidation functions are guarded by onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE). Unless the contracts are implemented in a manner that automatically grants a liquidator role to all new PartyB upon registration OR liquidation functions are made permissionless, PartyBs are likely not able to perform the liquidation themselves when the need arises.\n\nIn short, the counterparty (PartyA or PartyB) could not perform the liquidation required as mentioned by the sponsor in the second scenario because they are not granted the role of liquidator by default. Thus, this issue is still valid.\n\n**hrishibhat**\n\n@MoonKnightDev \n\n**shaka0x**\n\nEscalate.\n\nIn case liquidators are not incentiviced to perform the liquidation, the liquidator bots from the protocol will perform the task. From the README file:\n\n> Q: Are there any off-chain mechanisms or off-chain procedures for the protocol (keeper bots, input validation expectations, etc)?\n**Liquidator Bots**, Force close Bots, Force cancel Bots, Anomaly detector Bots\n\nI have commented on this fact in the issues #181 and #182:\n\n```\nThere is no incentive for liquidators to liquidate the position, since the liquidation fee is 0. So it will have to be done by the liquidator bot.\n```\n\n```\nAn important remark is that some liquidation processes do not have economic incentives for the liquidator, so in this cases the liquidation process relies completely on the protocol bots. \n```\nBut this is not an issue on its own.\n\n**sherlock-admin2**\n\n > Escalate.\n> \n> In case liquidators are not incentiviced to perform the liquidation, the liquidator bots from the protocol will perform the task.

Apart from the mentioned entry in the README file, the [docs](https://docs.symm.io/protocol-overview/general-information#post-trade-self-regulated-solvency) also state that there are additional mechanisms beyond 3rd party liquidators.\n\n> After the trade is executed both parties have to constantly ensure that their collateral and margin is sufficient to keep the trade open, 3rd party liquidators, **watchdogs and other tools** help to ensure that solvency of all parties in the system is given at all time.\n\n**abanchev**\n\nWatchdogs and other tools also refers to tools used by party B to ensure they are not liquidated themselves (alerts to notify them to supply more collateral if necessary). Protocol provides the tools for others to use, the protocol may also run a liquidator bot for extra profit but the goal is a system where everything is permissionless.\n\n**Navid-Fkh**\n\nWe don't consider this to be an issue. In the early stages, when we are restricted to trusted liquidators, we will have no problems as the liquidator will do the job. If we ever get to a permissionless system for liquidators, then any PartyB should likely run their own liquidator to prevent such situations.\n\n**hrishibhat**\n\nResult:\nMedium\nHas duplicates\nFrom the readme it is clear that the Liquidator is not trusted and not owned by the protocol. \nThe liquidators bots are incentivized by the protocol to do their actions, however, this is a valid issue where there is a flaw in this mechanism\n\n\n**sherlock-admin2**\n\nEscalations have been resolved successfully!\n\nEscalation status:\n- [shaka0x](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical-judging/issues/234/#issuecomment-1654270705): rejected\n\n",
