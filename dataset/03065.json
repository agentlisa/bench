  "Title": "[L03] Lack of input validation",
  "Content": "In the `initialize` functions of the `ExchangeRateUpdater` and `MintForwarder` contracts, the `newTokenContract` parameter is not checked to be either a valid contract or an ERC20 token. Moreover, the `newOwner` can be either an EOA or a contract but this is not described in the docstrings.\n\n\nConsider improving the docstrings to reflect the exact intended behaviour, and using [`Address.isContract`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L26) function from OpenZeppelin’s library to detect if an address is effectively a contract. Moreover, consider adopting the [`Initializable`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades/blob/master/packages/core/contracts/Initializable.sol) to implement the current functionality.\n\n\n***Update:** Partially fixed as of commit [`273a2b8`](https://github.com/coinbase/wrapped-tokens/pull/3/commits/273a2b8268d4a71ffb3762f805a7beeaf9dc44bd) in PR #3. While docstrings have been added, there are no checks for the input address parameters.*\n\n\n\n> Coinbase has acknowledged the lack of on-chain input validation and will verify the input programmatically and manually prior to launch.\n> \n> \n\n\n",
