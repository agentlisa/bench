  "Title": "[M-12] BackingManager: rsr is distributed across all rsr revenue destinations which is a loss for rsr stakers",
  "Content": "\nThe `BackingManager.handoutExcessAssets` function sends all `rsr` that the `BackingManager` holds to the `rsrTrader` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L173-L179>).\n\nThe purpose of this is that `rsr` which can be held by the `BackingManager` due to seizure from the `StRSR` contract is sent back entirely to the `StRSR` contract and not - as would happen later in the function (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L221-L242>) - shared across `rsrTrader` and `rTokenTrader`.\n\nThe `rsrTrader` then sends the `rsr` to the `Distributor` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/RevenueTrader.sol#L59-L65>).\n\nSo far so good. However the `Distributor` does not necessarily send all of the `rsr` to the `StRSR` contract. Instead it distributes the `rsr` according to its distribution table. I.e. there can be multiple destinations each receiving a share of the `rsr` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol#L108-L136>).\n\nIn economic terms, `rsr` that is thereby not sent to `StRSR` but to other destinations, is a transfer of funds from stakers to these destinations, i.e. a loss to stakers.\n\nStakers should only pay for recollateralization of the `RToken`, not however send revenue to `rsr` revenue destinations.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nAssume the following situation:\n\n*   A seizure of `rsr` from the `StRSR` contract occurred because the `RToken` was under-collateralized.\n\n*   A trade occurred which restored collateralization. However not all `rsr` was sold by the trade and was returned to the `BackingManager`.\n\nNow `BackingManager.manageTokens` is called which due to the full collateralization calls `BackingManager.handoutExcessAssets` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L118>).\n\nThis sends `rsr` to the `rsrTrader` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L173-L179>).\n\nThen the `rsr` is sent to the `Distributor` (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/RevenueTrader.sol#L59-L65>).\n\nThere it is distributed across all `rsr` destinations (<https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/b30ab2068dddf111744b8feed0dd94925e10d947/contracts/p1/Distributor.sol#L108-L136>).\n\n### Tools Used\n\nVSCode\n\n### Recommended Mitigation Steps\n\n`rsr` should be sent from the `BackingManager` directly to `StRSR` without the need to go through `rsrTrader` and `Distributor`. Thereby it won't be sent to other `rsr` revenue destinations.\n\nFix:\n\n    diff --git a/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol b/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol\n    index 431e0796..eb506004 100644\n    --- a/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol\n    +++ b/contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol\n    @@ -173,7 +173,7 @@ contract BackingManagerP1 is TradingP1, IBackingManager {\n             if (rsr.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {\n                 // For CEI, this is an interaction \"within our system\" even though RSR is already live\n                 IERC20Upgradeable(address(rsr)).safeTransfer(\n    -                address(rsrTrader),\n    +                address(stRSR),\n                     rsr.balanceOf(address(this))\n                 );\n             }\n\nThere is a caveat to this however:\n\nIt is possible for `rsr` to be a reward token for a collateral of the `RToken`.\n\nNeither the current implementation nor the proposed fix addresses this and instead sends the rewards to `StRSR`.\n\nIn principal, `rsr` that was rewarded should have a share that goes to the `rTokenTrader` as well as include all `rsr` revenue destinations.\n\nHowever there is no easy way to differentiate where the `rsr` came from.\n\nTherefore I think it is reasonable to send all `rsr` to `StRSR` and make it clear to developers and users that `rsr` rewards cannot be paid out to `rToken` holders.\n\n**[tbrent (Reserve) confirmed and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/276#issuecomment-1404405069):**\n > Yep, this one is a great find. \n\n**[tbrent (Reserve) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-reserve-findings/issues/276#issuecomment-1421609180):**\n > Fixed here: https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/pull/584\n\n**Status:** Mitigation confirmed.
