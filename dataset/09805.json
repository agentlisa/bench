This is not specific to NFTs minted on Foundation, it should work for any NFT. If royalty information was not defined when the NFT was originally deployed, it may be added using the Royalty Registry which will be respected by our market contract.\n\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-foundation/blob/4d8c8931baffae31c7506872bf1100e1598f2754/README.md?plain=1#L21\n\nUsing the Royalty Registry an owner can decide to change the royalty information right before the sale is complete, affecting who gets what.\n\n## Impact\nBy updating the registry to include the seller as one of the royalty recipients, the creator can steal the sale price minus fees. This is because if code finds that the seller is a royalty recipient the royalties are all passed to the creator regardless of whether the owner is the seller or not.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```solidity\n          // 4th priority: getRoyalties override\n          if (recipients.length == 0 && nftContract.supportsERC165Interface(type(IGetRoyalties).interfaceId)) {\n            try IGetRoyalties(nftContract).getRoyalties{ gas: READ_ONLY_GAS_LIMIT }(tokenId) returns (\n              address payable[] memory _recipients,\n              uint256[] memory recipientBasisPoints\n            ) {\n              if (_recipients.length > 0 && _recipients.length == recipientBasisPoints.length) {\n                bool hasRecipient;\n                for (uint256 i = 0; i < _recipients.length; ++i) {\n                  if (_recipients[i] != address(0)) {\n                    hasRecipient = true;\n                    if (_recipients[i] == seller) {\n                      return (_recipients, recipientBasisPoints, true);\n```\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-concur/blob/72b5216bfeaa7c52983060ebfc56e72e0aa8e3b0/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L127-L154\n\nWhen `true` is returned as the final return value above, the following code leaves `ownerRev` as zero because `isCreator` is `true`\n```solidity\n      uint256 ownerRev\n    )\n  {\n    bool isCreator;\n    (creatorRecipients, creatorShares, isCreator) = _getCreatorPaymentInfo(nftContract, tokenId, seller);\n\n    // Calculate the Foundation fee\n    uint256 fee;\n    if (isCreator && !_nftContractToTokenIdToFirstSaleCompleted[nftContract][tokenId]) {\n      fee = PRIMARY_FOUNDATION_FEE_BASIS_POINTS;\n    } else {\n      fee = SECONDARY_FOUNDATION_FEE_BASIS_POINTS;\n    }\n\n    foundationFee = (price * fee) / BASIS_POINTS;\n\n    if (creatorRecipients.length > 0) {\n      if (isCreator) {\n        // When sold by the creator, all revenue is split if applicable.\n        creatorRev = price - foundationFee;\n      } else {\n        // Rounding favors the owner first, then creator, and foundation last.\n        creatorRev = (price * CREATOR_ROYALTY_BASIS_POINTS) / BASIS_POINTS;\n        ownerRevTo = seller;\n        ownerRev = price - foundationFee - creatorRev;\n      }\n    } else {\n      // No royalty recipients found.\n      ownerRevTo = seller;\n      ownerRev = price - foundationFee;\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nIn addition, if the index of the seller in `_recipients` is greater than `MAX_ROYALTY_RECIPIENTS_INDEX`, then the seller is omitted from the calculation and gets zero (`_sendValueWithFallbackWithdraw()` doesn't complain when it sends zero)\n```solidity\n        uint256 maxCreatorIndex = creatorRecipients.length - 1;\n        if (maxCreatorIndex > MAX_ROYALTY_RECIPIENTS_INDEX) {\n          maxCreatorIndex = MAX_ROYALTY_RECIPIENTS_INDEX;\n        }\n```\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-foundation/blob/4d8c8931baffae31c7506872bf1100e1598f2754/contracts/mixins/NFTMarketFees.sol#L76-L79\n\nThis issue does a lot of damage because the creator can choose whether and when to apply it on a sale-by-sale basis. Two other similar, but separate, exploits are available for the other blocks in `_getCreatorPaymentInfo()` that return arrays but they either require a malicious NFT implementation or can only specify a static seller for which this will affect things. In all cases, not only may the seller get zero dollars for the sale, but they'll potentially owe a lot of taxes based on the 'sale' price. The attacker may or may not be the creator - creators can be bribed with kickbacks.\n\n## Tools Used\nCode inspection\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nAlways calculate owner/seller revenue separately from royalty revenue\n\n\n",
