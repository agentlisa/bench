  "Content": "The [`revokeAuthorization`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol#L37) function in [`PermissionsLib`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol) performs a linear search over an array of unbounded size. Through subsequent calls to [`authorize`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol#L28), the array could grow to a size so large that a call to `revokeAuthorization` would be prohibitively expensive and [not fit in a block](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#gas-limit-and-loops).\n\n\nConsider modifying the [`Permissions`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol#L23) struct to include a `mapping` to save the index of each authorized address in the [`authorizedAgents`](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/blob/b110959477cf37375bf7e9344d40eb85219c8575/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol#L25) array. In this way it will not be necessary to perform a linear search at all.\n\n\n***Update:** Fixed across [several commits](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/charta/commits/69bd071eee2ac14cd41a5221f6e602174e9dd237/contracts/libraries/PermissionsLib.sol).*\n\n\n",
