  "Content": "* In [line 38](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Registry.sol#L38) of `Registry.sol`, the comment should start with “The address of each financial contract is mapped to its index…”.\n* In [line 48](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Registry.sol#L48) of `Registry.sol`, “their associated FinancialContract struct” should say “their associated Party struct”.\n* In [line 76](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Registry.sol#L76) of `Registry.sol`, the comment is an incomplete thought.\n* In [line 127](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Registry.sol#L127) of `Registry.sol`, “to” should be “from”.\n* In [line 25](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/VoteTiming.sol#L25) of `VoteTiming.sol`, “floor(timestamp/phaseLength)” should say “floor(timestamp/roundLength)”.\n* In [line 22](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/DesignatedVoting.sol#L22) of `DesignatedVoting.sol`, an inline comment claims that the `Owner` role can set the `Withdrawer` role, but actually the `Owner` and `Withdrawer` roles [are permanently the same role](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/DesignatedVoting.sol#L39).\n* In [line 55](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/ResultComputation.sol#L55) of `ResultComputation.sol`, the `minVoteThreshold` is described as an inclusive bound but it is actually an exclusive bound. Similarly, [the comment in line 72](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/ResultComputation.sol#L72) should say “exceeded” instead of “met”.\n* In [line 549](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Voting.sol#L549) of `Voting.sol`, the comment references a non-existent `isActive` function.\n* In [line 71](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Governor.sol#L71) of `Governor.sol`, there is a redundant `@param` comment.\n* In [line 154](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/9d403ddb5f2f07194daefe7da51e0e0a6306f2c4/core/contracts/oracle/implementation/Governor.sol#L154) of `Governor.sol`, the comment states the proposal data will be zeroed after execution but the `requestTime` will remain.\n\n\n**Update:** *Partially fixed in [PR#1213](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/1213). The comment in line 127 of `Registry.sol` has been fixed in [PR#1206](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/1206). The erroneous comment in line 25 of `VoteTiming.sol` has not been addressed.*\n\n\n",
