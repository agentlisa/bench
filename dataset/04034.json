  "Title": "[L04] Emergency shutdown defined at the wrong level",
  "Content": "The emergency shutdown functionality is defined in the [`PerpetualPositionManager` contract](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/c452750a073488aa9b7caa86bb6206396412dcf9/packages/core/contracts/financial-templates/perpetual-multiparty/PerpetualPositionManager.sol#L508), but it is also used in its parent, the [`FundingRateApplier` contract](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/c452750a073488aa9b7caa86bb6206396412dcf9/packages/core/contracts/financial-templates/common/FundingRateApplier.sol#L271). Instead of defining the common functionality at a common base level of inheritance, it is defined at the bottom level and accessed in an unclear way by the parent. Since this parent contract has no access to the emergency shutdown functions and modifiers, it duplicates the code.\n\n\nConsider extracting the emergency shutdown functionality to a separate contract that gets inherited by the first parent contract that requires it.\n\n\n**Update**: *Fixed in [PR#2310](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/2310).*\n\n\n",
