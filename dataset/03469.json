  "Content": "The `BridgePool` contract [inherits from `ExpandedERC20`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/f24ad501c8e813cf685f72217e7f13c8f3c366df/packages/core/contracts/insured-bridge/BridgePool.sol#L34) so that it can issue LP tokens to liquidity providers. This inherits the functionality of OpenZeppelin’s `ERC20` contract and also [provides administrator privileges](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/blob/f24ad501c8e813cf685f72217e7f13c8f3c366df/packages/core/contracts/common/implementation/ExpandedERC20.sol#L36) to the contract deployer, which allows them to mint and burn LP tokens. However, this power is not required and, if exercised, could unfairly penalize liquidity providers.\n\n\nConsider modifying `BridgePool` to inherit directly from `ERC20` instead of `ExpandedERC20`.\n\n\n**Update:** *Fixed in commit [`370e8b21b660543eadbd764fed984a5bdeddce24`](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/3492/commits/370e8b21b660543eadbd764fed984a5bdeddce24) in [PR3492](https://github.com/UMAprotocol/protocol/pull/3492).*\n\n\n",
