  "Title": "Potential Re-Entrancy Attack in the Crowdinvesting Contract ✓ Fixed",
  "Content": "\n\n#### Resolution\n\n\n\n[Fixed](https://github.com/corpus-io/tokenize.it-smart-contracts/blob/19bd32b835ff24ff2c7decf70adbd8ac5968a931/contracts/Crowdinvesting.sol#L295) by storing the currency early in the function to the memory and reusing that value.\n\n\n#### Description\n\n\nThe attack requires a set of pre-requisites:\n\n\n1. The currency token should have a re-entrancy opportunity inside the token transfer.\n2. The re-entrancy can be done on a token transfer from the `_msgSender()` to the `feeCollector`, so there are not a lot of attackers who can potentially execute it.\n3. The owner should be involved in the attack, so it’s most likely an attack by the owner.\n\n\n**contracts/Crowdinvesting.sol:L277-L290**\n\n\n\n```\nfunction buy(uint256 \\_amount, address \\_tokenReceiver) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {\n // rounding up to the next whole number. Investor is charged up to one currency bit more in case of a fractional currency bit.\n uint256 currencyAmount = Math.ceilDiv(\\_amount \\* getPrice(), 10 \\*\\* token.decimals());\n\n (uint256 fee, address feeCollector) = \\_getFeeAndFeeReceiver(currencyAmount);\n if (fee != 0) {\n currency.safeTransferFrom(\\_msgSender(), feeCollector, fee);\n }\n\n currency.safeTransferFrom(\\_msgSender(), currencyReceiver, currencyAmount - fee);\n \\_checkAndDeliver(\\_amount, \\_tokenReceiver);\n\n emit TokensBought(\\_msgSender(), \\_amount, currencyAmount);\n}\n\n```\nSo on the token transfer to the `feeCollector` above, the `currency` parameter can be changed by the `owner`. And the following token transfer (`currency.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), currencyReceiver, currencyAmount - fee);`) will be made in a different currency.\n\n\nA possible scenario of the attack could look as follows:\n\n\n1. Malicious owner sells tokens for a valuable currency. People are placing allowance for the tokens.\n2. The owner changes the currency to a new one with a much lower price and re-entrancy during transfer.\n3. When a victim wants to buy tokens, the owner reenters on fee transfer and returns the old currency.\n4. The victim transfers the updated currency that is more expensive.\n\n\n#### Recommendation\n\n\nSave the currency in memory at the beginning of the function and use it further.\n\n\n\n",
