  "Content": "\nIn [Mailbox, function `_verifyDepositLimit`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/72f5f16ed4ba94c7689fe38fcb0b7d27d2a3f135/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L275C1-L281C6), the code after the `if` statement is never executed as `address(0)` is hard-coded and ETH deposits are uncapped (see the comment):\n\n```solidity\n    function _verifyDepositLimit(address _depositor, uint256 _amount) internal {\n        IAllowList.Deposit memory limitData = IAllowList(s.allowList).getTokenDepositLimitData(address(0)); // address(0) denotes the ETH\n        if (!limitData.depositLimitation) return; // no deposit limitation is placed for ETH\n\n        require(s.totalDepositedAmountPerUser[_depositor] + _amount <= limitData.depositCap, \"d2\");\n        s.totalDepositedAmountPerUser[_depositor] += _amount;\n    }\n```\n\nAlthough, [AllowList, function `setDepositLimit`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/72f5f16ed4ba94c7689fe38fcb0b7d27d2a3f135/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/common/AllowList.sol#L129C1-L132C6) does **NOT** enforce it.\n\n```solidity\n    function setDepositLimit(\n  address _l1Token,\n  bool _depositLimitation,\n  uint256 _depositCap\n) external onlyOwner {\n  tokenDeposit[_l1Token].depositLimitation = _depositLimitation;\n  tokenDeposit[_l1Token].depositCap = _depositCap;\n}\n```\n\nConsider changing it to `revert` if trying to cap ETH deposits.\n\n```diff\n    function setDepositLimit(\n        address _l1Token,\n        bool _depositLimitation,\n        uint256 _depositCap\n    ) external onlyOwner {\n+       require(_l1Token != address(0), \"ETH deposits cannot be limited\");\n        tokenDeposit[_l1Token].depositLimitation = _depositLimitation;\n        tokenDeposit[_l1Token].depositCap = _depositCap;\n    }\n```\n\nAlso, consider removing the whole `_verifyDepositLimit` function, as it will always return without modifying the state of the contract (tautology).\n\n```diff\n-   function _verifyDepositLimit(address _depositor, uint256 _amount) internal {\n-       IAllowList.Deposit memory limitData = IAllowList(s.allowList).getTokenDepositLimitData(address(0)); // address(0) denotes the ETH\n-       if (!limitData.depositLimitation) return; // no deposit limitation is placed for ETH \n\n-       require(s.totalDepositedAmountPerUser[_depositor] + _amount <= limitData.depositCap, \"d2\");\n-       s.totalDepositedAmountPerUser[_depositor] += _amount;\n-   }\n```\n\nNOTE: `Mailbox` is for ETH, which is uncapped, and tokens are bridged via the bridges, which do check for the deposit limits themselves, so there is no place for that function here.\n\n",
