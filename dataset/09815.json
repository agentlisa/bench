It's currently set to `4` and only 5 creators are paid out.\nOther creators are ignored.\n\n## Recommended Mitigation Steps\nI don't think cases with more than 5 creators / royalty receivers are unlikely.\nIt can and should probably be increased, especially as the transfers are already gas restricted.\n\n\n",
